# User Life Cycle Schedule

The User Life Cycle schedule monitors the profile validation process in GroupID. It performs the
following main functions in keeping with the user profile validation settings for an identity store:

- Monitors the profile validation dates of users
- Generates reminder emails
- Disables users who do not validate their profiles within the given period

   generated for the schedule. Users are redirected to this portal to perform any necessary action.
8. In the **Scheduler Service Name** drop-down list, select a Scheduler service that would be
   responsible for triggering this schedule. The number of services displayed in the list depend on
   the number of Elasticsearch clusters in the environment, as each cluster has its own Scheduler
