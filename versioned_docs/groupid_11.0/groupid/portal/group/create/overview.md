# Groups

Using GroupID portal, you can create:

- An unmanaged group or a static group.

  - A static group is a group you would normally create in a directory (for example, by using the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in). Though such groups can be created using GroupID portal, GroupID does not support dynamic updates to
    them. Any changes to the membership have to be updated manually.
- A managed group or a Smart Group or a Dynasty.

  - A Smart Group (normal Smart Group and Smart Group with a password expiry condition)

    A Smart Group is one that dynamically maintains its membership based on rules. These rules are applied in the form of a user-defined query, such as an LDAP query. This query is defined once and scheduled for membership update using a Smart Group Update job. When the Smart Group update job runs, it applies the defined rules to update the group's memberships.

    In this way, Smart Groups are automatically updated whenever the directory information changes. This automated group management allows administrators to easily maintain large distribution lists and security groups without having to manually add or remove members.
  - A Dynasty is a Smart Group that creates and manages other Smart Groups using information in the directory. Dynasties help you manage large distribution lists by creating hierarchical group structures that represent your organization’s hierarchy.
