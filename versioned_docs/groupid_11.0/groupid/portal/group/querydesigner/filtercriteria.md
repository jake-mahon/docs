# Query Designer - Filter Criteria tab

Use this tab to add custom criteria to your query that do not fit any of the categories represented on other tabs of the Query Designer dialog box. For example, you can add criteria to retrieve all directory users who live in Houston and have a fax
number. You can also apply logical operators (AND, OR) to your custom query to achieve the most accurate results.

If the administrator in your role's Query Designer policy has defined a default filter criteria, that filter criteria is displayed on this tab. You can view and copy the query using the __View Query__ button. See the [Specify a Default Filter Criteria](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/securityrole/policy/querydesigner.md#specify-a-default-filter-criteria) section of the [ Query Designer Policy](/versioned_docs/groupid_11.0/groupid/admincenter/securityrole/policy/querydesigner.md) topic.

The default criteria is part of the policy; therefore, in GroupID portal it is visible to the role members only.

Let's say the administrator has defined the following default criteria in the policy:

department is exactly HR

You can add another row of filter criteria in the portal query designer window, if need be.

__Select Attribute__

By default, this is the only list displayed on the tab. It displays all or specific schema and Exchange attributes, depending on what the GroupID administrator has configured.

Select an attribute to be searched. For example, to search for users who live in the city of Houston, select the City attribute from this list.

__Contains__

From here, select the condition that identifies search results. The following table lists the available conditions:

NOTE: Depending on configurations made by the GroupID administrator for the portal, all of the following or specific conditions will be displayed in the list.

The condition list for query based searches may vary.

| Condition | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Contains | Returns everything that contains the value.  NOTE: This is resource-intensive for the directory server. |
| Does Not End With | Returns everything that does not end with the value.  NOTE:  This is resource-intensive for the directory server. |
| Does Not Start With | Returns everything that does not start with the value. |
| Ends With | Returns everything that ends with the value. (  NOTE: This is resource-intensive for the directory server. |
| Greater Or Equal | Returns everything with a value greater than or equal to the given value. |
| Is Exactly | Returns everything that matches the value. |
| Is Not | Returns everything that does not match the value. |
| Less Or Equal | Returns everything with a value less than or equal to the given value. |
| Not Contain | Returns everything that does not contain the value.  NOTE: This is resource-intensive for the directory server. |
| Not Present | Returns everything that does not have the specified value. |
| Present | Returns everything that has the value. |
| Starts With | Returns everything that starts with the value. |
| All Flags On | Performs bit-wise comparison to find objects that have all the specific flags set for the attribute according to the given value. The value must be a decimal number; it cannot be a hexadecimal number or a constant name.  For example, to search all users who do not need a password (decimal value of PASSWD\_NOTREQD flag = 32) and whom passwords never expires (decimal value of DONT\_EXPIRE\_PASSWORD flag = 65536), set the value of UserAccessControl's attribute against this condition to 65568 (65536 + 32). For more information, refer to the article [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305144](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305144). |
| All Flags Off | Performs bit-wise comparison to find objects that have all the specific flags not set for the attribute according to the given value. The value must be a decimal number; it cannot be a hexadecimal number or a constant name.  For example, to search all users which are neither disabled (decimal value of ACCOUNTDISABLE flag =2) nor locked out (decimal value of LOCKOUT flag = 16), set the value of UserAccessControl's attribute against this condition to 18 (2 + 16). For more information, refer to the article [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305144](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/305144). |
| Any Flag On | Performs bit-wise comparison to find objects that have any of the specific flag set for the attribute according to the given value. The value must be a decimal number; it cannot be a hexadecimal number or a constant name.  For example, to search all users who do not need a password (decimal value of PASSWD\_NOTREQD flag = 32) or whom passwords never expires (decimal value of DONT\_EXPIRE\_PASSWORD flag = 65536), set the value of UserAccessControl's attribute against this condition to 65568 (65536 + 32).

| Chain Match | Limited to the attributes of DN (distinguished name) type only. This is a special extended filter that walks the chain of ancestry in objects all the way to the root until it finds a match. For example, you can use this filter with the __ManagedBy__ attribute to find all the groups for which the selected user is a direct or indirect owner. |

__Value__

Specify a value for the attribute. The query will return results considering the specified criteria (attribute, condition, value).

For some operators, the Value box is not available, as in the case of Present or Not Present. This happens when the operators are not comparison operators. They only check whether the value for the selected field exists and return either TRUE or FALSE.

__AND__

Click this button after selecting two or more records to insert a logical AND to the selected criteria.

To select a record, click the arrow icon next to it and click __Select Row__.

__OR__

Click this button after selecting two or more records to insert a logical OR to the selected criteria.

To select a record, click the arrow icon next to it and click __Select Row__.

__Clear__

Use this button to clear the given criteria.

__Preview__

Enables you to preview the results returned with the criteria specified on all tabs of the Query Designer dialog box. This is a check to ensure the accuracy of data before changes are committed to the directory.

__OK__

Saves settings and closes the dialog box.

__Cancel__

Discards settings and closes the dialog box.

__LDAP Query__

View the provider query in the LDAP Query box.
