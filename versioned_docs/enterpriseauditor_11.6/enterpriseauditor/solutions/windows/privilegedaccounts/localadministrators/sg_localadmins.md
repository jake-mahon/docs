## Least Privilege Model

The SG_LocalAdmins job typically uses an account that is a member of the Local Administrators group on the target host. However if a less-privileged option is required, you can instead use a regular domain user that has been added to the __Network access: Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM__ Local Security Policy.
