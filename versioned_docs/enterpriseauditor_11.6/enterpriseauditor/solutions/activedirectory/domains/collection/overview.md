The 0.Collection Job Group is comprised of:

- [AD_DomainControllers Job](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/activedirectory/domains/collection/ad_domaincontrollers.md) – Collects domain controller details which will be further analyzed in order to provide information on domains, sites, and trusts.
- [AD_DSRM Job](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/activedirectory/domains/collection/ad_dsrm.md) – Collects data related to domain controller registry settings for the DSRMAdminLogonBehavior key. If this key is set to 1 or 2, the DSRM Admin Account can be used to log in to the domain controller even if it has not been started in DSRM which can present a potential security vulnerability. Additional information on this registry key is available in this [Microsoft Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc732714(v=ws.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).
- [AD_TimeSync Job](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/solutions/activedirectory/domains/collection/ad_timesync.md) – Collects TimeSync information from the registry for each domain controller within the domain
