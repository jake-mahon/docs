The default analysis tasks are:

- Lists high risk Samba share configurations – Creates the SA_UX_Samba_HighRiskSambaShares table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Highlights hosts with a large number of risky shares – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the UX_NFS job produces the following pre-configured report:

| Report | Description | Default Tags | Report Elements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Samba Shares with Potentially Insecure Configurations | This report identifies Samba shares with parameters which may lead to open access | None | This report is comprised of three elements:   - Bar Chart – Displays Top Hosts by Potentially Insecure Shares - Table – Provides details on Top Hosts by Potentially Insecure Shares bar chart - Table – Provides details on List of Potentially Insecure Share Configurations |
