# Copying Cells

Copying an individual cell within a generated report enables easier searching for information using
the AIC or other tools. The copy feature can only be used on interactive grids. Each cell listed
under a column can be selected and copied to the clipboard.

To copy a cell, select the cell, then right-click on it and select **Copy Cell Data**.

**NOTE:** You may need to allow programmatic clipboard access for your browser the first time you
attempt to copy a cell.
