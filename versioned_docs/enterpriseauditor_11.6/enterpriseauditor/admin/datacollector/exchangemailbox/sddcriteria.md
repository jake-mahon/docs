# ExchangeMailbox: SDD Criteria

The SDD Criteria page is where criteria to be used for discovering sensitive data are configured. It is a wizard page for the Mailbox sensitive data discovery category. This page requires the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On to be been installed on the Enterprise Auditor Console to define the criteria and enable the Criteria Editor. See the [Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On Installation](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/install/sensitivedatadiscovery/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Select the checkbox for the criteria to be used to search for sensitive data. Criteria can also be selected using the __Select All__ and __Select None__ buttons.

The table contains the following types of criteria:

- System Criteria – Lists pre-defined criteria
- User Criteria – Lists user-defined criteria

  __NOTE:__ Until the Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On is installed, only the headers for the System Criteria and User Criteria nodes will be visible in the table.
- Edit – Click this button to access the Criteria Editor where user-defined criteria can be created or customized. See the [Sensitive Data Criteria Editor](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/sensitivedatadiscovery/criteriaeditor/overview.md) topic for additional information.
- Store discovered sensitive data – Stores the potentially sensitive data that matches the selected criteria in the Enterprise Auditor database. Select this checkbox to store a copy of the criteria match data. This copy can be used to check for false positives, data that matches the selected criteria but is not actually sensitive.
- Limit stored matches per criteria to [number] – Identifies the number of potentially sensitive data matches that are copied to the database. The default is 5 matches. This option is only available if the __Store discovered sensitive data__ option is selected.
