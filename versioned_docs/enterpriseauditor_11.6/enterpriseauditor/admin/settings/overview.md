# Global Settings

The global settings have an overall impact on the running ofEnterprise Auditor jobs. Settings are inherited through a parent-child structure from the Settings node through the Jobs tree to the individual jobs unless inheritance is broken by direct assignment at either the job group or the individual job level.
