# Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) Configuration

Enterprise Auditor can use a previously-configured Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA/MSA) account. Make sure that Managed Service Account is selected in the User Credentials window. See the [Create a Connection Profile](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/connection/profile/create.md) or [Create a Schedule Service Account](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/schedule.md#create-a-schedule-service-account) topic for additional information.

To run a job or scheduled task with a gMSA/MSA account, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with must have permissions to retrieve the gMSA account password
- The gMSA account must be a Local Admin in the target hosts
- The gMSA account does not have to be a local admin in the Enterprise Auditor Console
- The Data Collector used must support unicode characters in the Connection Profile's credential password to retrieve the gMSA account password

__NOTE:__  For FSAA, remote scans using gMSA credentials need to use the Windows Service launch mechanism in the query configuration.

See the Microsoft [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview) article for additional information.
