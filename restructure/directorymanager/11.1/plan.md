# Directory Manager 11.1 Documentation Restructure Plan

## Goals

1. **Flatten navigation** by removing the redundant `directorymanager` folder level.
2. **Enforce kebab-case** (lowercase words separated by hyphens) for every new folder and file name. The only exception is Docusaurus’ special `_category_.json` files, which must retain their leading underscore.
3. **Limit nesting depth** to improve discoverability. Where logical, two deep levels are maintained; deeper paths occur only for very granular configuration areas (e.g. _Admin Center ➜ Identity Store ➜ Configure ➜ Directory Service ➜ PPE ➜ Rules_).
4. **Preserve one-to-one mapping** between legacy and new files to keep git-history intact. No more than one document is merged into another.
5. **Align with Docusaurus IA guidance** by ensuring that every folder that should appear in the sidebar provides either an `index.md` or `_category_.json`.

## Key Structural Decisions

### 1. Remove the duplicate product folder

The existing path `docs/directorymanager/11.1/directorymanager/…` created an unnecessary level. All content is moved to `docs/directorymanager/11.1/…`.

### 2. Standardise naming

Examples:

- `admincenter` → `admin-center`
- `datasource` → `data-source`
- `identitystore` → `identity-store`
- `ResetPassword.md` → `reset-password.md`

### 3. Category boundaries

Immediate sub-directories of the product root become _top-level_ sidebar categories. Child directories become nested categories automatically thanks to the `autogenerated` sidebar items.

### 4. Sidebar strategy

The new `sidebars/directorymanager/11.1.js` uses Docusaurus’ _autogenerated_ feature so that future documents placed in the correct folder automatically appear in navigation. A small handcrafted section points to the overview page, after which the rest of the tree is inserted via `type: 'autogenerated'`.

## Follow-up Work (out-of-scope)

- Update all intra-doc markdown links to reflect the new paths.
- Update any external references (blog posts, KBs, etc.) that deep-link to the old structure.
- Validate redirects once the site is rebuilt.
