# Installation

The GroupID installer auto detects the prerequisite software and Windows features that GroupID
requires, and installs them without any manual intervention. This has practically simplified GroupID
installation, reduced workloads, and diminished installation time.

Furthermore, GroupID configuration and upgrade has been seamlessly integrated into the installation
experience.
