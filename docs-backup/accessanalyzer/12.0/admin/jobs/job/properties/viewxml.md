This opens the job’s XML file, which contains all of the job, query, and reporting configurations.
When the log level is directly set at job level, the job XML `<JOBLOGLEVEL>` parameter will show a
value of:

- 0 for Debug
- 1 for Info
- 2 for Warning
- 3 for Error

**NOTE:** Job analysis configurations are kept in a separate XML file.
