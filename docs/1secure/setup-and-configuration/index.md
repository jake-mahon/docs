# Configure IT Infrastructure for Auditing and Monitoring

Netwrix 1Secure relies on native logs for collecting audit data. Therefore, successful change and
access auditing requires a certain configuration of native audit settings in the audited environment
and on the computer where Netwrix Cloud Agent resides. Configuring your IT infrastructure may also
include enabling certain built-in Windows services, etc. Proper audit configuration is required to
ensure audit data integrity, otherwise your change reports may contain warnings, errors or
incomplete audit data.

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically when creating a monitoring plan. This is a recommended method.
- Manually.

# Configure IT Infrastructure for Auditing and Monitoring

You can configure your IT Infrastructure for monitoring in one of the following ways:

- Automatically when creating an organization. This is a recommended method.
- Manually. The table below lists the native audit settings that must be adjusted manually to ensure
  collecting comprehensive and reliable audit data. You can enable Netwrix 1Secure to continually
  enforce the relevant audit policies or configure them manually.

| Active Directory  | Active Directory Activity         | In the audited environment: See [Configure Domain for Monitoring Active Directory](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/active-directory/manual-configuration.md) for related settings and procedures. On the computer where Netwrix Cloud Agent is installed: - If you have enabled automatic log backup for the Security log of your domain controller, you can instruct Netwrix 1Secure to clear the old backups automatically. For that, use the **CleanAutoBackupLogs** registry key It is recommended that you adjust retention period for the backup files accordingly (default is **50** hours). - To provide for event data collection, the Secondary Logon service must be up and running . Open **Administrative Tools**→**Services**, right-click the **Secondary Logon** service and on the **General** tab make sure that **Startup type** for this service is other than _Disabled_. |
| Active Directory  | Active Directory Logons           | In the audited environment: - The following policies must be set to _"Success"_ and _"Failure"_ for the effective domain controllers policy: - Audit Logon Events - Audit Account Logon Events - The Audit system events policy must be set to _"Success"_ for the effective domain controllers policy. - The Advanced audit policy settings can be configured instead of basic. - The Maximum Security event log size must be set to 4GB. The retention method of the Security event log must be set to _“Overwrite events as needed”_ or _"Archive the log when full"_. - The following Windows Firewall inbound rules must be enabled: - Remote Event Log Management (NP-In) - Remote Event Log Management (RPC) - Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)                                                                                                                                        |
