Review a full list of protocols and ports required for monitoring Active Directory, Exchange, and
Group Policy.

- Allow outbound connections from the dynamic (1024 - 65535) local port on the computer where
  Netwrix Cloud Agent resides.

- Allow outbound connections to remote ports on the source and inbound connections to local ports on
  the target.

Tip for reading the table: For example, on the computer where Netwrix Auditor Server resides
(source), allow outbound connections to remote 389 TCP port. On domain controllers in your domain
(target), allow inbound connections to local 389 TCP port.
