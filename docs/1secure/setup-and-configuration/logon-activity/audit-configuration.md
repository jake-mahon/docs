# Configure Advanced Audit Policies

You can configure advanced audit policies instead of basic domain policies to collect Logon Activity
changes with more granularity.

Follow the steps to configure security options.

Using both basic and advanced audit policies settings may lead to incorrect audit reporting. To
force basic audit policies to be ignored and prevent conflicts, enable the Audit: Force audit policy
subcategory settings to override audit policy category settings option.

**Step 1 –** Open the **Group Policy Management** console on any domain controller in the target
domain: navigate to Start > Windows Administrative Tools> **Group Policy Management.**

**Step 2 –** In the left pane, navigate to **Forest: `<forest_name>` > Domains > `<domain_name>` >
Domain Controllers**. Right-click the effective domain controllers policy (by default, it is the
**Default Domain Controllers Policy**), and select **Edit** from the pop-up menu.

**Step 3 –** In the Group Policy Management Editor dialog, expand the Computer Configuration node on
the left and navigate to Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security
Options.

**Step 4 –** Locate the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings to override audit policy
category settings and make sure that policy setting is set to _"Enabled"_.

# Configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules

For successful data collection, Netwrix 1Secure may have to create inbound Firewall rules. If you do
not enable the Network traffic compression option, the product will try creating these rules
automatically and will notify you it fails to do so. In this case, you have to configure Windows
Firewall inbound rules manually.

Follow the steps to configure Windows Firewall Inbound Connection Rules.

**Step 1 –** On every domain controller, navigate to **Start** > **Control Panel** and select
**Windows Firewall**.

**Step 2 –** In the **Help Protect your computer with Windows Firewall** page, click **Advanced
settings** on the left.

**Step 3 –** In the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security dialog, select Inbound Rules on the
left.

![manualconfig_nla_inbound_connections2016](/img/product_docs/1secure/configuration/logonactivity/manualconfig_nla_inbound_connections2016.webp)

**Step 4 –** Enable the following inbound connection rules:

- Remote Event Log Management (NP-In)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC)
- Remote Event Log Management (RPC-EPMAP)
