# Data Collecting Account

The data collecting account is a service account that Netwrix 1Secure uses to collect audit data
from the monitored items (domains, OUs, servers, etc.). Netwrix recommends creating a dedicated
service account for that purpose. Depending on the data source and connector, the account must meet
the corresponding requirements (see the table below).

You can use group Managed Service Account (gMSA) as data collecting account. See the
[Using Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)](/docs/1secure/data-sources/gmsa.md) topic for additional information.

Currently, the following data sources are supported:

| Data source       | Provided connectors                               | Required rights and permissions:                                                                                                                                                               |
