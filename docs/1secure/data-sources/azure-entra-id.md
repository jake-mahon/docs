# Microsoft Entra ID Auditing

The product supports Microsoft Entra ID  (formerly Azure AD) provided within Microsoft Office 365.

Netwrix 1Secure allows you to audit Office 365 organizations that have established modern
authentication as their identity management approach, including support for
[multi-factor authentication (MFA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks).

In this scenario, Netwrix 1Secure will access the cloud-based infrastructure via Microsoft Graph and
other modern APIs, being authenticated through a pre-configured Microsoft Entra ID application with
appropriate access permissions. So, you should register a Microsoft Entra ID  app and provide its
settings to Netwrix 1Secure when configuring a monitored item.

## Multi-factor Authentication

Support for modern authentication will allow you to audit the organizations where MFA is enabled for
all users, including service accounts. See the
[App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md)
topic for additional information.

**Step 1 –** Click **Configuration** in the top bar. The Managed organizations page is displayed,
that lists the managed organizations defined in 1Secure.

**Step 2 –** Click an organization to define a data source and connector(s) for it. The properties
page for the organization is displayed with the Sources tab selected by default.

**Step 3 –** On the Sources tab, click **Add** to add a source. The Select Data Source (Step 1 of 3)
pane is displayed.

![Configure Source Details %28Step 2 of 3%29 pane](</img/product_docs/1secure/admin/organizations/sourcesandconnectors/entra_configsourcedetails(step2of3).webp>)

**Step 5 –** On the Configure source details (Step 2 of 3) pane, specify the following settings:

- Source Group – Specify a name for the group to which the data source will belong. Grouping
  sources, such as computers, allows them to share a common configuration and makes it easier to
  manage related sources together.
- Tenant ID – The tenant ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
  [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
  for additional information.
- Crawl Source – Toggle this option to ON to enable data collection for the source
- Service Account Entra ID Groups – Specify Microsoft Entra ID groups to exclude their service
  accounts from billable domain accounts so that they are not audited. To specify a Microsoft Entra
  ID group, enter its name and click the **Add** icon. To specify multiple Microsoft Entra ID
  groups, add them one by one.
- Credentials – Displays the crdentials that have already been added, while also providing the
  option to add new credentials. Netwrix 1Secure uses these credentials to connect to the data
  source. You can select existing credentials or add new ones. To add new credentials, select **Add
  new Credentials** from the drop-down menu or click the **Add** icon, then specify the following:

  - Client ID – The client ID of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
    for additional information.
  - Client Secret – The client secret of the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [App Registration and Configuration in Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md) topic
    for additional information.
  - Download Certificate – For certain connectors, such as SharePoint Online State, authentication
    requires a certificate instead of a client secret. Download this certificate and then upload
    it to the app registered in Microsoft Entra ID. See the
    [Upload a Certificate](/docs/1secure/setup-and-configuration/azure-entra-id/registration.md#upload-a-certificate) topic
    for additional information.
  - Display Name – Specify a name you want to show for your credentials. It will be displayed on
    the Credentials tab of the Managed Organizations page.

**Step 6 –** Click **Next**.

![Choose New Connector %28Step 3 of 3%29 pane](</img/product_docs/1secure/admin/organizations/sourcesandconnectors/entra_connector(step3of3).webp>)

**Step 7 –** The Choose new connector (Step 3 of 3) pane lists three connectors for Microsoft Entra
ID. Specify the following:

- Entra ID Activity – Toggle the **Entra ID Activity** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for
  this connector. With this, you can generate activity reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the
  [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/reporting/report-types/activity-reports.md#microsoft-entra-id) topic for additional
  information.
- Entra ID Logons – Toggle the **Entra ID Logons** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for this
  connector. With this, you can generate logon reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the
  [Microsoft Entra ID](/docs/1secure/reporting/report-types/activity-reports.md#microsoft-entra-id) topic for additional
  information.

  - Collect Failed Logons – Select this checkbox to collect the failed logon data for Microsoft
    Entra ID logon reports.
  - Collect Successful Logons – Select this checkbox to collect the successful logon data for
    Microsoft Entra ID logon reports.

- Entra ID State – Toggle the **Entra ID State** switch to ON to collect and monitor data for this
  connector. With this, you can generate state-in-time reports on Microsoft Entra ID data. See the
  [State In Time Risks Reports](/docs/1secure/reporting/report-types/state-in-time-reports.md) topic for additional
  information.

**Step 8 –** Click **Finish**.

The Microsoft Entra ID data source and connector(s) have been configured.
