# First Login to 1Secure

This topic describes how an MSP can access the 1Secure tenant for the first time, activate their
account, and complete the initial login. After logging in, the MSP can add users to the tenant and
assign them roles based on the required access levels.

When the Netwrix team adds a new user account for your organization, you will receive an email
invitation. This email will be sent from "noreply-account@netwrix.com" and will have the subject
"Welcome to Netwrix 1Secure".

This email includes a unique access link to product’s web portal. You need to activate your account
via the link within 2 days. If it expires, you will need to follow the link and request a new
activation link.

  article for additional information.

After successful authorization, You are redirected to the dashboard. See the
[1Secure Dashboard](/docs/1secure/admin/dashboard/index.md) topic for additional information.

Once the initial login is completed, an MSP can configure Single Sign On (SSO) using supported
authentication services, including Entra ID, 1Secure Authentication, or OpenID Connect. See the
[SSO Configuration with Authentication Services](#sso-configuration-with-authentication-services)
topic for additional information.

## Single Sign On

Single Sign On (SSO) is a powerful authentication process that enhances security and improves user
experience by allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials.
Single Sign On (SSO) allows you to log in to 1Secure using Microsoft Entra ID or Open ID Connect
credentials. It enhances the user experience by enabling access with existing organizational
credentials.

### Log In Through Single Sign On

Users can log in to the 1Secure tenant using Single Sign On (SSO) if their accounts are added to the
authentication provider configured for the tenant. For example, if Microsoft Entra ID is configured
as the authentication provider and its users are added to 1Secure, they can log in to the 1Secure
tenant with their Microsoft Entra ID credentials.

When the Netwrix team adds a new user account for your organization, you will receive an email
invitation. This email will be sent from "noreply-account@netwrix.com" and will have the subject
"Welcome to Netwrix 1Secure".

![1Secure Invitation Email](/img/product_docs/1secure/admin/login/1secureinvitation-sso.webp)

**Step 1 –** Click **Access 1Secure** button in the invitation email. You are navigated to the
1Secure login page.

![Log In page](/img/product_docs/1secure/admin/login/companylogin.webp)

**Step 2 –** On the login page, click the **Log In** button.

**Step 3 –** In the Email address field, specify a valid email address registered with 1Secure, then
click **Continue**. Based on your authentication status, one of the following will occur:

- If you are logged out of your authentication provider, you will be redirected to the
  authentication provider's login page. For example, if you are using Microsoft Entra ID, you will
  be redirected to the Microsoft Entra ID login page. Authenticate using your credentials. After
  successful authentication, you will be logged in to 1Secure.
- If you are already logged in to your authentication provider, then you will be directly logged in
  to 1Secure application.

### SSO Configuration with Authentication Services

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for tenant users, an MSP must configure SSO using one of the
following authentication services:

- [Configure SSO with Microsoft Entra ID Authentication](#configure-sso-with-microsoft-entra-id-authentication)
- [Configure SSO with OpenID Connect Authentication](#configure-sso-with-openid-connect-authentication)

**NOTE:** When you first log in to 1Secure, SSO is not enabled, and 1Secure Authentication is
applied by default. This method requires Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to verify your identity
for secure access. See the [Log In](/docs/1secure/admin/index.md) topic for additional information on
Multi-factor authentication.
