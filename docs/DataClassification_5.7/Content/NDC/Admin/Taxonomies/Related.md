# Related

The Related tab allows you to view and modify the non-hierarchical relationships between preferred terms. This tab will only appear if the taxonomy is in SQL, as the SharePoint Term Store does not support this functionality.

When a term is located in multiple branches of the taxonomy (a polyhierarchical taxonomy) – the Related tab will also display each of the locations to allow you to jump to the specific branch.
