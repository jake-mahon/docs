# Content Sources

A *content source* in terms of Netwrix Data Classification is a repository of data to be crawled and classified. Each content source has an individual configuration and, where appropriate, credentials.

For adding and managing content sources, use the **Content Configuration**→Sources area of the Netwrix Data Classification management console.

**IMPORTANT!** To access the **Sources** area, users require sufficient rights. See the [User Management](../../Security/UserManagement) section for more information.

You can manage the individual content sources or organize them into source groups, which are used as logical containers.

**NOTE:** You can configure the unlimited number of sources to work with.
