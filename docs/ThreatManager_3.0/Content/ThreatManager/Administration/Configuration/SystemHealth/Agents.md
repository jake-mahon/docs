# Agents

The Agents Overview reports which Threat Prevention agents have successfully sent events to Threat Manager. This requires a minimum version of Threat Prevention7.5. This section may be used to troubleshoot or diagnose agent issues by indicating the connectivity of the Threat Prevention agent to the Threat Manager server.

Clicking **Decommission** will remove an agent from the Threat Manager agent list.

If an active agent has not contacted the Threat Manager server for 10 minutes, it will be placed into offline mode. This will generate an alert in Threat Manager. In the instance that an agent has become unresponsive, a magenta alert banner displays, located just below the navigation header.
