# PowerShell Action Module

The PowerShell action module provides methods of running PowerShell scripts on the local machine or
on remote hosts. Define PowerShell scripting actions using the PowerShell Action Module Wizard.

**CAUTION:** Ensure that only the changes required are applied and only to those target systems
desired.

Access Analyzer action modules contain one or more selectable operations. Each operation performs
its function on a single object per row from the source table defined in the action.

## Configuration

The PowerShell action module is configured through the PowerShell Action Module Wizard, which
contains the following wizard pages:

- Welcome
- [PowerShell Action: Script](script.md)
- [PowerShell Action: Execution Options](executionoptions.md)
- [PowerShell Action: Summary](summary.md)

The Welcome page displays first and gives an overview of the action module. The navigation pane
contains links to the pages in the wizard.

To proceed, click **Next** or use the Steps navigation pane to open another page in the wizard.
