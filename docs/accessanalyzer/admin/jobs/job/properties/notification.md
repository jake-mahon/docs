# Notification Tab

The Notification tab is where email notifications are configured at the job level. Choose either to
inherit the global configuration or to configure settings just for this job.

Deselect the **Use Global Settings** option to configure custom settings for the job. Then provide a
specific list of recipients for email notifications generated by this job. Multiple email addresses
can be input by adding a semicolon (;) and space between entries. This is specific to Notification
analysis module tasks.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
no changes were made.
