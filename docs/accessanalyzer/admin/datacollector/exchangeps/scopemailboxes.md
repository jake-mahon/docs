# ExchangePS: Scope by Mailboxes

The Scope by Mailboxes page is used to define specific mailboxes to search. This page is enabled
when the **Scope by Mailbox Target Host: Local Host** option is selected on the Scope page. See the
[ExchangePS: Scope](scope.md) topic for additional information.

When using the applet, the data collector will return mailboxes for the Exchange Forest in which the
Access Analyzer Console currently resides, and only return information about those mailboxes. For
Remote PowerShell, the data collector will return mailboxes for the Exchange Forest as well as
return information about those mailboxes.

**Add**. The selected mailboxes are added in the Selected Mailboxes list. To remove undesired
mailboxes from Selected Mailboxes, select them and click **Remove**. The Select All and Clear All
buttons can be used for quick selection.
