# Edit Query

Use the **Edit Query** option to modify host lists created by a Host Discovery query.

![Edit Query option on Activities pane](../../../../../static/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/powershell/editquery.webp)

In the Navigation pane, select the query-created host list to edit and click **Edit Query**. The
Host Discovery Wizard opens to the Query page where the query settings for the selected
query-created host list are modified. See the
[Host Discovery Wizard](../../hostdiscovery/wizard/overview.md) topic for information on modifying
these settings.
