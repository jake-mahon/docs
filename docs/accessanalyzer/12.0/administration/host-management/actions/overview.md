The available actions are:

- [Add Hosts](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/add.md) – Create a new host list by manually entering hosts or importing a host list
  (only available in the Host Management node)
- [View/Edit Host](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/viewhost.md) – Open the Host Details View, which displays the collected host
  inventory information for the selected host in an easier-to-read format and allows you to manually
  edit the host inventory information
- [Delete Host(s)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/deletehost.md) – Delete host from the selected list (permanently deletes host
  from the host master table if used in the Host Management node)
- [Import Location](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/importlocation.md) – Import the physical location data for hosts from a CSV file
  or database without creating a new host list. Location column is in the
  [Host Inventory Data Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/datagrid.md).
- [Refresh Hosts](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/refresh.md) – Manually executes the host inventory query for the selection

  grid view
- [Save Selected To List](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/savetolist.md) – Create a static host list from the selected hosts within
  the current data grid
- [Schedule (Activities Pane Option)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/schedule.md) – Opens a customized Schedule Properties window
  to schedule a host inventory query
- [Export Data](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/export.md) – Export the current data grid to a HTML, XML, or CSV file
- [Suspend/Resume Host Inventory](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/suspend.md) – Pause an **In progress** host inventory or resume a
  paused **In queue** host inventory
- External commands – Sub-header (not activity) that separates the Activities above which occur
  within the Access Analyzer Console from the Activities below which open external processes:

  - Manage Host – Opens the Microsoft Management Console interface for the selected host if it has
    that feature enabled
  - Explore Host – Opens Windows Explorer, displaying the shares on the selected host
  - Ping Host – Opens a Command Prompt to run a ping command targeting the selected host
  - Trace Route to Host – Opens a Command Prompt to run the `TraceRoute` command, locating a path
    to the selected machine in less than 30 hops

- [Edit List](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/editlist.md) – Edit the selected host list in the Host List Wizard
- [Edit Query](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/host-management/actions/editquery.md) – Edit the Host Discovery query settings for the selected query-created

  already been assigned to a job for execution)
