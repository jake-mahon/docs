# Chart Configuration Wizard

The Chart Configuration wizard allows you to configure the charts that display on reports. The
wizard opens when you select to configure a Chart widget from the Widgets page of the Report
Configuration Wizard. See the [Widgets Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/reporting/wizard/widgets.md) topic for additional information.

The Chart Configuration wizard consists of three pages:

- [Chart Format](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/reporting/chartwizard/chartformat.md)
- [Data Source](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/reporting/chartwizard/datasource.md)
- [Configure](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/reporting/chartwizard/configure.md)

Once you have finished configuring the chart, click **Finish** to close the wizard. You are returned
to the Widgets page of the Report Configuration wizard, where the newly configured chart is shown.
You must complete the Report Configuration wizard to save the chart on the report.
