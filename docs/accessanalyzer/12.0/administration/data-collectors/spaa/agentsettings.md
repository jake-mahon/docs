# SPAA: Agent Settings

The Agent Settings page is where the SharePoint Agent Service is configured. It is a wizard page for
the category of Scan SharePoint Access.

The **Enable Agent Service Scans** checkbox enables collecting SharePoint data through the agent
services instead of directly from SharePoint. This option requires a **Network Port** to be entered.
Agent Service Identity radio buttons are:

- Use Job Credentials when job has same credentials as agent services
- Use Custom Identity for other agent service credential scenarios
  - Specify identity in the format `spn:name` or `upn:name`
  - The token `%HOST%` may be substituted for the host name

This option requires the SharePoint Agent to be installed on the application server. See the
[SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/installation/sharepointagent/overview.md) topic for additional
information.
