# Box: Additional Scoping

The Additional Scoping page is where the scan can be limited by depth of the scan. It is a wizard
page for the Scan Box Permissions category.

Configure the scan depth level:

- Limit scanned depth to: [number] level – Select the checkbox and set the scan depth level to the
  desired depth. If this checkbox is not selected, then the entire Box environment will be scanned,
  according to the [Box: Exclusions Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/data-collectors/box/exclusions.md) settings. If the scoping depth is set to
  **0** then only root will be scanned. Each increment will add another level of depth from root
  level.
