# Connection Tab

The Connection tab is for configuring the Connection Profile. Choose to use the default settings
(the global configuration or configuration set via broken inheritance at a job group level), to use
the system default (the account being used to run Access Analyzer), or to select another Connection
Profile.

**NOTE:** It is a best practice to set the Connection Profile at the same level where the job’s host
list is set. For example, if the host list is set under the job group’s **Settings** node, then that
is where the Connection Profile should be configured. If the host list is set under the **[Job]** >
**Configure** node, then this is where the Connection Profile should be configured.

Select the desired option to identify the required Connection Profile for the job. See the
[Connection Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/job-management/group/connection.md) topic for additional information for the three
connection options.

Click **OK** to save configuration changes and close the Job Properties window. Click **Cancel** if
no changes were made.
