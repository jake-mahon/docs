# Access

Configure what applications, users, and groups have access to Access Analyzer using the Access node

![Access Window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/settings/access/access.webp)

The first type of access that can be granted is Role Based Access for a user or group accessing the
Access Analyzer Console. The second type of access grants access to an application accessing data
remotely through the Web Service using the REST API. See these sections for additional information:

- [Role Based Access](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/settings/access/role-based/overview.md)
- [Web Service REST API for Applications Accessing Data Remotely](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/settings/access/rest-api/overview.md)

The Access Analyzer vault provides enhanced security through enhanced encryption to various
credentials stored by the Access Analyzer application. See the
[Application](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/settings/application/overview.md) topic for additional information.

The **Cancel** and **Save** buttons are in the lower-right corner of the Roles view. These buttons
are enabled when modifications are made to the Roles global setting.

Whenever changes are made at the global level, click **Save** and then **OK** to confirm the
changes. Otherwise, click **Cancel** if no changes were intended.
