The primary sections of the Access Analyzer Console are:

- [Navigation Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/navigation/pane.md) – Navigate through all of Access Analyzer’s major functions using the
  Navigation Pane. Selecting a node or sub-folder in the Navigation Pane will change what can be
  done in the Results Pane.
- [Results Pane](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/navigation/resultspane.md) – Displays various interfaces based on what is selected in the
  Navigation Pane or Activities Pane

  the currently selected console section

Access Analyzer Data Grids also have specific navigation options that enable users to filter, group,
and search through data. See the [Data Grid Functionality](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/navigation/datagrid.md) topic for additional
