# Report Configuration Wizard

You can use the Report Configuration Wizard to configure reports. The wizard can be launched for an
existing report or when creating a new report. See the [Creating a Report](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/create.md) and
[Editing Existing Reports](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/edit.md) topics for additional information.

Follow the steps to configure a report using the wizard.

**NOTE:** Skip any sections or pages that do not require changes to the existing configuration.

**Step 1 –** Create a new report or open the Report Configuration wizard for an existing report.

**Step 2 –** Configure the settings on the [Authoring Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/wizard/authoring.md) page. These include Name,
Header information, and publish settings. Click **Next**.

**Step 3 –** On the [E-mail Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/wizard/email.md) page, use the inherited settings or configure report
specific settings. Click **Next**.

**Step 4 –** The [Publish Security Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/wizard/publish-security.md) page is only enabled if role-based
access is configured for the Access Analyzer console. On this page you can view and configure
accounts with permissions to view the report. If you are not using role-based access, you can skip
this page. Click **Next**.

**Step 5 –** On the [Layout Page](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/reporting/wizard/layout.md) page, select the number of rows using the dropdown
menu. Then select the desired pre-defined layout from the options displayed. Click **Next**.

layout.

- If you do not want to save your changes or have not made any changes, click **Cancel** on any page
  to exit the wizard without saving your changes.

Your configuration has been saved. For information on how to view your report, see the
