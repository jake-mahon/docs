# SQLViewCreation Analysis Module

The SQLViewCreation analysis module provides the ability to create new views or tables that are used
in Access Analyzer actions and reports. These views or tables are re-created during job execution.

**CAUTION:** Consider the impact on storage and performance when choosing to create views versus
tables. Tables require more storage space in the database.

## Configuration

This analysis module provides the View and Table Creation Analysis Module wizard to assist in
configuring the module. Before the wizard, collect the desired data for manipulation.

The wizard contains the following pages:
