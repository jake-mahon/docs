# SPAA: Additional Scoping

The Additional Scoping page is where the scan can be limited by depth of the scan. It is a wizard
page for the categories of:

- Scan SharePoint Access
- Scan For Sensitive Content

**CAUTION:** Users should not change scans in a way that would result in less data being returned on
a subsequent scan (i.e. scanning fewer web applications, scanning fewer site collections, or a
shallower depth scan). Those resources not included in a subsequent scan are marked as deleted in
the Tier 2 database and subsequently removed from the Tier 1 database.

If checked, set the **Limit scanned depth to: [number] level(s)** option to the desired depth. If
this option is not checked then the entire farm is scanned. If the scoping depth is set to **0**
then only root site collections are scanned. Each increment to the depth adds an additional level of
depth from that point.

Check the **Perform differential scan** box to enable the job to run a differential scan.
Differential scanning is enabled by default. When this option is enabled, SPAA scan will only parse
files for content/SDD if it has been modified since the last scan.

**NOTE:** This option only applies to Tag collection and Sensitive data collection. Files will be
still be scanned for permissions regardless of whether this option is checked or not.
