# Installing the SharePoint Agent

The installer will prompt for credentials which are used to set the identity that the SharePoint
Access Auditor Agent service runs as. The agent service does no additional impersonation, so this is
the account used to connect to and enumerate SharePoint. The service account credentials provided
need to be a member of the Log on as a service local policy. Additionally, the credentials provided
for Step 5 should also be a part of the Connection Profile used by the SharePoint Solution within
the Access Analyzer Console. See the
[SharePoint Scan Options](../../requirements/solutions/sharepoint/scanoptions.md) topic for detailed
permission information.

Follow the steps to install the SharePoint Agent on the application server which hosts the Central
Administration component of the targeted SharePoint farms.

**Step 1 –** Run the `SharePointAgent.exe` executable to open the Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly
Enterprise Auditor) SharePoint Agent Setup Wizard.
