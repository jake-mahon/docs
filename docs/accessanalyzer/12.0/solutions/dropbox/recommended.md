# Recommended Configurations for the Dropbox Solution

The Dropbox Solution requires the host list to be assigned and the Connection Profile configured
before job execution. Once these are assigned to the job group, it can be run directly or scheduled.

Targeted Hosts

The Dropbox solution has been configured to inherit the host list assignment from the collection job
group level.

The host list assignment should be assigned under the **Dropbox** > **0.Collection** >
**Settings** > **Host List Assignment** node. Select the **Local host** option.

Connection Profile

The DropboxAccess Data Collector requires a specific set of permissions to generate an access token
which is used to configure the Connection Profile for Dropbox. The access token is generated in the
Dropbox Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard on the Scan Options page (accessed through the
**1-Dropbox_Permissions Scan** job’s **Queries** node). The access token only needs to be generated
once, prior to running the job group for the first time. Then it is used as the credential in the
Connection Profile. See the
[DropboxAccess: Scan Options](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/data-collection/dropbox-access/scan-options.md) topic for
additional information.

The Dropbox solution has been configured to inherit the Connection Profile from the collection job
group level. The Connection Profile should be assigned under the **Dropbox** > **0.Collection** >
**Settings** > **Connection** node. It is set to **Use the Default Profile**, as configured at the
global settings level. However, since this may not be the Connection Profile with the necessary
permissions for Dropbox, select the **Select one of the following user defined profiles** option and
select the appropriate Connection Profile from the drop-down menu. See the
[Custom Dropbox Connection Profile & Host List](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/data-collection/dropbox-access/configure-job.md)
topic for additional information on configuring the Dropbox credential. The Dropbox bulk import jobs
requires the same connection profile as used in the corresponding Dropbox scan jobs

See the [Connection](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/settings/connection/overview.md) topic for additional information
on creating Connection Profiles.

Schedule Frequency

The Dropbox solution can be scheduled to run as desired.

History Retention

Not supported and should be turned off.

Multi Console Support

Not supported.

Run Order

The 0.Collection jobs must be run first and in order. Run the **1-Dropbox_Permissions Scan** job and
then the **2-Dropbox_Permissions Bulk Import** job. For the sensitive data jobs, run the
**1-Dropbox_SDD Scan** job and then the **2-Dropbox_SDD Bulk Import** job.

**_RECOMMENDED:_** When running the sensitive data jobs, disable the permissions jobs, and vice
versa.

After running the 0.Collection jobs, the other Dropbox solution job groups can be run in any order.
Best practice is to run at the solution level.

Query Configuration

This solution can be run with the default query configurations. The Scoping page of the Dropbox
Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard can be customized to target specific user accounts. See the
[DropboxAccess: Scoping](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/data-collection/dropbox-access/scoping.md) topic for additional
information.

Analysis Configuration

This solution should be run with the default analysis configuration.

**CAUTION:** Do not modify or deselect the selected analysis tasks. The analysis tasks are
preconfigured for this solution.

Though the analysis tasks should not be deselected the time frame used to define staleness can be
modified:

- Stale content set to default of 365 days

  - Configured within the **4.Content** > **Dropbox_Content** job
  - **Determines stale data by owner** analysis task
  - See the [4.Content > Dropbox_Content Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/dropbox/dropbox-content.md) topic for additional information

Additional Consideration

The jobs contained in the solution use custom SQL scripts to render views on collected data. SQL
views are used to populate report element tables and graphs. Changing or modifying the group, job,
or table names will result in no data displayed within the Access Information Center.

Workflow

The following is the recommended workflow:

**Step 1 –** Run the **1-Dropbox_Permissions Scan** job (for sensitive data, run the **1-Dropbox_SDD
Scan** job).

**Step 2 –** Run the **2-Dropbox_Permissions Bulk Import** job (for sensitive data, run the
**2-Dropbox_SDD Bulk Import** job).

**Step 3 –** Run the desired corresponding analysis and reporting sub-job groups.

_Remember,_ prior to running the Dropbox solution for the first time, it is necessary to generate an
access token to be used in the Connection Profile. This only needs to be done once. See the
[Configure the Dropbox Access Query](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/dropbox/collection/1-dropbox-permissions-scan.md#configure-the-dropbox-access-query)
topic for additional information.
