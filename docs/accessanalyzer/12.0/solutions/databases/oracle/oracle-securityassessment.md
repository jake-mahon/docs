The default analysis task is:

- Summarize Audit Findings – Aggregates all security issues in the Oracle environment. Creates the
  #scopeOfAudit table used to create the Oracle Security Assessment report under the Configure >
  Reports node

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis task, the Oracle_SecurityAssessment Job
produces the following pre-configured report.
