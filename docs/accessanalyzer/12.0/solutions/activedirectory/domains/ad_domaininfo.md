- Sites – Targets one domain controller per forest to retrieve domain site information
- Domains – Targets one domain controller per forest to retrieve domain information
- Trust Filtering – Queries the host specified to retrieve domain trust information
- dSHeuristics – Returns dSHeuristics Unicode string using LDAP

The default analysis tasks are:

- Domain Summary – Creates interim processing tables in the database for use by downstream analysis
  and report generation
- Site Summary – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis
  and report generation
- Trust Details – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis
  and report generation
- dSHeuristics Details – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream
  analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_DomainInfo Job produces
the following pre-configured reports:
