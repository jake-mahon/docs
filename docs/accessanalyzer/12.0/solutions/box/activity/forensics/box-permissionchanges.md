The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- Permission Change Details – Creates the Box_PermissionChange_Details table accessible under the
  job’s Results node

  downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks, the Box_PermissionChanges Job produces the
