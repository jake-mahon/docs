It is dependent on data collected by the
[SharePoint Access Auditing](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-access-auditing),
[SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek),
and [SharePoint Activity Auditing](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md#sharepoint-activity-auditing) components
of the [0.Collection Job Group](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/sharepoint/collection/overview.md). It also depends on the running of the
sub-job groups within the solution. If only select sub-job groups have been run, there will be blank
sections of this overview report.
