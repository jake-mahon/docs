The first step in creating a Host Discovery query is to select the source where the query searches
for hosts. Hosts are discoverable using one of the following options:

- [Scan IP Network](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/ip-network.md) – Scans a specified range of IP Addresses for active hosts and
  resolves the names of machines using DNS
- [Query an Active Directory Server (General)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/ad-general.md) – Scans the default domain controller
  or a specified server for all computer objects, can be scoped
- [Query an Active Directory Server (Discover Exchange servers)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/ad-exchange.md) – Scans the default
  domain controller or a specified server but is scoped to return only computer objects sitting in
  the configuration container for Exchange servers
- [Query an Active Directory server (Discover Domain Controllers)](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/ad-domain-controllers.md) – Scans
  the default domain controller or a specified server but is scoped to return only machines which
  are domain controllers
- [Import From a Local CSV File](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/csv.md) – Imports a host list from a specified CSV file
- [Import From a Database](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/wizard/database.md) – Imports a host list from a specified SQL Server database

**NOTE:** The Advanced Options checkbox in the lower-left corner is a legacy item and should not be
selected.
