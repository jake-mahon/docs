# Rename List

Use the Rename List option to change the name of a selected host list. This option is available only
from an individual host list node.

**CAUTION:** Changing the name on a host list that has been assigned to a job can cause the job to
fail.

the new name for the host list and click **OK**.

**NOTE:** Host list names can also be changed using the **Edit List** option, see the
