# Host Management

The **Host Management** node is used to manage hosts in a targeted environment. Hosts configured
under the **Host Management** node can be audited using other features in Access Analyzer. This node
maintains information for audited computers. To view information on all computers in the
environment, use the
[.Active Directory Inventory Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/solutions/active-directory-inventory/overview.md),
specifically the Active Directory Summary report.

The Host Management node provides a master list of every host ever introduced to Access Analyzer.
Introduce hosts through [Host Discovery Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/overview.md) queries or by entering
them manually. Hosts are removed from this list only by manually deleting them. This master listing
of hosts, or the Host Master Table, is designed around unique host names, not necessarily unique
hosts themselves. The data grid provides all host inventory information collected on the hosts. See
the [Host Inventory Data Grid](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/data-grid.md) topic for additional information.

The Host Management process consists of the following phases:

- Host Discovery – The process of discovering hosts to audit through Host Discovery queries, which
  can be scoped to identify computers with commonalities. These queries are managed under the Host
  Discovery node. See the [Host Discovery Node](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/discovery/overview.md) topic for additional
  information.
- Host Inventory – The process of collecting key pieces of information about each host to aid in
  segregating the hosts into logical sub-groupings for targeted auditing. Use either the Host
  Discovery or Host Management nodes.
- Host List Creation – Access Analyzer creates Default host lists based on Host Inventory results.
  Create and manage Custom host lists under the Host Management node. See the
  [Hosts Lists](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/host-management/lists.md) topic for additional information.

The nodes under the Host Management node are:

- Default hosts lists
- Host lists generated by Host Discovery queries
- Custom host lists

See the [Host Inventory](/docs/accessanalyzer/12.0/administration/settings/host-inventory.md) topic for global settings that affect Host
Management.
