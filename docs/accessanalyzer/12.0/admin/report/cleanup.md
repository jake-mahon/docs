# Report Cleanup when Deleting a Job or Job Group

When deleting a job or job group, the Delete Job and Delete Group wizards allow you to delete any
published reports contained in the jobs that are being deleted. Follow the steps to delete a job or
job group that contains published reports.

**CAUTION:** Deleted objects cannot be restored.

**Step 2 –** On the Delete Job/Group page of the wizard, confirm it shows the correct job or group
that you want to delete, then click **Next**.

**NOTE:** If there are no published reports, clicking **Next** starts the deletion (skip to step 4).

**Step 4 –** The Progress page shows you the status of the deletion process. When it has completed,
click **Finish** to exit the wizard.

The job or job group and all of the selected published reports have been deleted. If you chose not
to delete any of the published reports contained in any of the deleted jobs, then those remaining
reports can still be viewed in the Web Console, even though the parent has been removed from the
Access Analyzer Console.

The remaining published reports that weren't deleted are shown in the wizard if you are deleting the
parent group of the previously deleted job or group.
