# Publish Security Page

The Publish Security page of the Report Configuration wizard contains the account names of users
with inherited permissions to view the generated report.

**NOTE:** This page is only enabled if Role Based Access is configured for the Access Analyzer
Console. See the [Role Based Access](../../settings/access/rolebased/overview.md) topic for
additional information.

Roles assigned at the global level are inherited down to the report configuration. Additional report
viewer privileges can also be added at the job group or job levels.

De-select the Include Report Reviewers from this object's parent checkbox to remove all inherited
accounts with the Report Viewer role.

You can add additional users, groups, and service accounts with the Report Viewer role at the Report
level. This gives them the permission to view the specific report in the Web Console. Follow the
steps to add an account.
