# ExchangeMetrics Data Collector

The ExchangeMetrics Data Collector collects Mail-Flow metrics from the Exchange Message Tracking Logs on the Exchange servers. Some examples of this include server volume and message size statistics. This data collector runs as an applet over RPC connection to process and collect summarized metrics from the Message Tracking Log. See the [Exchange Support and Permissions Explained](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/solutions/exchange/support.md) topic for a complete list of supported platforms.

The ExchangeMetrics Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Exchange Solution. Both this data collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the [Exchange Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/exchange/overview.md) topic for additional information.
