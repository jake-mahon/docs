# SMARTLog: Log State

The Log State page is used to configure how to search the log. It is a wizard page for all log types.

Select the __Persist log state__ checkbox to search the log from where the search last left off. A state file is created for each host configured in the query. State files can be viewed within Access Analyzer and are named by the query GUID. State files display the record the search last left off on, the event log, and the date of the last entry.
