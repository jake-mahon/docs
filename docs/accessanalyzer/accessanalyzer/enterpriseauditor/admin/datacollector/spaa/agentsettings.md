# SPAA: Agent Settings

The Agent Settings page is where the SharePoint Agent Service is configured. It is a wizard page for the category of Scan SharePoint Access.

The __Enable Agent Service Scans__ checkbox enables collecting SharePoint data through the agent services instead of directly from SharePoint. This option requires a __Network Port__ to be entered. Agent Service Identity radio buttons are:

- Use Job Credentials when job has same credentials as agent services
- Use Custom Identity for other agent service credential scenarios
  - Specify identity in the format ```spn:name``` or ```upn:name```
  - The token ```%HOST%``` may be substituted for the host name

This option requires the SharePoint Agent to be installed on the application server. See the [SharePoint Agent Installation](/docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/install/sharepointagent/overview.md) topic for additional information.
