Use the following options to select which sources of data to permit and the time frame in which the data was collected:

- Source Data Details – Choose a data source. This option is for when the selected tables are from two separate Access Analyzer Consoles using tables generated by the same job.

  __NOTE:__ This section is enabled after selecting __All Access Analyzer Tables__ or __All tables in the database__ on the Input Scope page.

  - All data – Uses all data available from the selected option on the Input Scope page and merges the data
  - Data from this Access Analyzer Console only – Uses only data from the Access Analyzer Console generating the current analysis module
- Time Window – Select a time window for each table in the analysis. The drop-down menu selections vary based on each table's history settings.
