# Databases Solution

The core components for Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) are the Access Analyzer Console server, SQL Server, and Access Information Center. See the [Requirements](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/overview.md) topic for the core requirements.

In addition to these, integration with either the Netwrix Activity Monitor is required for event activity data to be scanned. See the [Netwrix Activity Monitor Documentation](https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/category/activitymonitor) for installation requirements and information on collecting activity data.

See the following topics for target environment requirements:

- [Target Db2 Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/target/databasedb2.md)
- [Target MongoDB Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/target/databasemongodb.md)
- [Target MySQL Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/target/databasemysql.md)
- [Target Oracle Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/target/databaseoracle.md)
- [Target PostgreSQL Requirements, Permissions, and Ports](/docs/product_docs/accessanalyzer/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/requirements/target/databasepostgresql.md)

## Databases Solution Requirements on the Access Analyzer Console

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment:

| Environment | Extra-Large | Large | Medium | Small |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | > 1 TB database size | Up to 1 TB database size | ~250 GB database size | ~50 GB database size |
| RAM | 24 GB | 16 GB | 12 GB | 4 GB |
| Cores | 8 CPU | 8 CPU | 4 CPU | 2 CPU |
| Disk Space | 460 GB | 280 GB | 160 GB | 80 GB |

__NOTE:__ If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host.For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).

Additional Server Considerations for Oracle Scans

For scanning Oracle databases, the following are additional requirements for the Console server:

- Windows Management Framework 3+ installed
- PowerShell 3.0+ installed
- NMAP installed
- For Instance Discovery, NMAP installed

Additional Server Considerations for SQL Server Scans

For scanning SQL databases, the following are additional requirements for the Console server:

- Windows Management Framework 3+ installed
- PowerShell 3.0+ installed

Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing Requirement

__NOTE:__ The appropriate JDK (Java) version for Sensitive Data Discovery is installed on the server. The JDK deployed is prepackaged and does not require any configuration; it has been preconfigured to work with Access Analyzer and should never be customized through Java. It will not conflict with other JDKs or Java Runtimes in the same environment.

## Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server

RAM, CPU, and Disk Space

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment.

| Environment | Extra-Large | Large | Medium | Small |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | > 1 TB database size | Up to 1 TB database size | ~250 GB database size | ~50 GB database size |
| RAM | 64 GB | 32 GB | 16 GB | 8 GB |
| Cores | 16 CPU | 12 CPU | 8 CPU | 4 CPU |
| Number of Disks | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| Operating System Disk | 160 GB | 160 GB | 160 GB | 160 GB |
| SQL Database Disk | 500 GB | 320 GB | 240 GB | 100 GB |
| SQL Transaction Log Disk | 120 GB | 100 GB | 80 GB | 40 GB |
| SQL TEMP DB Disk | 320 GB | 240 GB | 160 GB | 80 GB |
