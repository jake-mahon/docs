The default analysis tasks are:

- List group object permissions – Creates the SA\_AD\_GroupPermissions\_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Summarize group object permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation
- Group Ownership – Lists the owners of each group object and determines if they are a non-standard owner. Principals that are not administrators are considered non-standard owners of group objects.
- Group Ownership Summary – Summarizes owner type by domain
