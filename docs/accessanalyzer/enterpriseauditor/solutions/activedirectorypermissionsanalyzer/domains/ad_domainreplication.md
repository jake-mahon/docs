The default analysis tasks are:

- List domain replication permissions – Creates the SA_AD_DomainReplication_Details table accessible
  under the job’s Results node
- Summarize replication permission details – Creates an interim processing table in the database for
  use by downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_DomainReplication Job
produces the following pre-configured report.
