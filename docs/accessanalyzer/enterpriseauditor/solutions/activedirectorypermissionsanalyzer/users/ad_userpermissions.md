The default analysis tasks are:

- List user object permissions – Creates the SA_AD_UserPermissions_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Summarize user object permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation
- User Ownership – Lists the owners of each user object and determines if they are a non-standard owner. Principals that are not administrators are considered non-standard owners of user objects. Creates the SA_AD_UserOwnership_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node.
- User Ownership Summary – Summarizes the owner type by domain
