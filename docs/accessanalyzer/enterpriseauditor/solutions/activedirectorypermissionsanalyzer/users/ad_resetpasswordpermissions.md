The default analysis tasks are:

- List user password reset permissions – Creates the SA_AD_ResetPasswordPermissions_Details table accessible under the job’s Results node
- Summarize password reset permissions – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation

In addition to the tables and views created by the analysis tasks, the AD_ResetPasswordPermissions Job produces the following pre-configured report.
