They need to remain in the default order:

- 1. Create Function – Creates an interim processing table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation
- 2. Find Unresolved SID ACLs – Creates the SA\_SP\_UnresolvedSIDs\_DirectPermissions table accessible under the job’s Results node
- 3. Find Affected Resource Count per SID – Creates the SA\_SP\_UnresolvedSIDs\_ResourceCount table accessible under the job’s Results node
- 4. Rank Resources by SID Count – Creates the SA\_SP\_UnresolvedSIDs\_DirectPermissions table accessible under the job’s Results node

In addition to the tables created by the analysis tasks which display direct permissions for unresolved SIDs, the SP\_UnresolvedSIDs Job produces the following pre-configured report:

| Report | Description | Default Tags | Report Elements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unresolved SID Permissions | Unresolved SIDs can be safely cleaned up without affecting user access. | None | This report is comprised of three elements:   - Bar Chart – Displays top 5 unresolved SIDs by affected resources - Table – Provides details on resources with unresolved SIDs applied - Table – Provides details on unresolved SIDs by affected resources |
