It is dependent on data collected by the [SharePoint Access Auditing](collection/overview.md#sharepoint-access-auditing), [SharePoint Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing (SEEK)](collection/overview.md#sharepoint-sensitive-data-discovery-auditing-seek), and [SharePoint Activity Auditing](collection/overview.md#sharepoint-activity-auditing) components of the [0.Collection Job Group](collection/overview.md). It also depends on the running of the sub-job groups within the solution. If only select sub-job groups have been run, there will be blank sections of this overview report.
