The jobs in the 0.Collection Job Group are:

- [.AppletStatusCheck Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/appletstatuscheck.md) – Checks the health and status of the applet deployed to the target Exchange servers
- [EX\_MetricsCollection Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/ex_metricscollection.md) – Comprised of multiple queries that utilize the Exchange Metrics Data Collect to process and collect the message tracking logs on the Exchange servers in the environment. These queries collect server, domain, user, and distribution list traffic including but not limited to sent, received, journal, NDRs, and transports message. These queries are configured to process and collect that previous 7 days of Message Tracking Logs the first time this job is run, after that it only collects the previous day assuming persistence has not been disabled inside the query.
- [EX\_MetricsDetails Job](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/exchange/hubmetrics/collection/ex_metricsdetails.md) – Collects user to user traffic per day

  __NOTE:__ This job's query needs to be configured to the internal domains from which to collect the sender to recipient traffic. By default, the query is configured to collect the previous 1 day of Message Tracking Logs and has @netwrix.com configured as the domain. If the domains are not configured in the query, then most likely data collection does not return.
