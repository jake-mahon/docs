# 5. Public Folders Job Group

The 5. Public Folders job group is comprised of data collection, analyses, and reports that focus on public folder sizing, content aging, entitlement, ownership, and the identification of each public folder’s Most Probable Owner. The Most Probable Owner is a unique algorithm built into the public folder data collector that is determined based on folder ownership, content posted, and size of content posted.

The __5. Public Folders__ > __Ownership__ job group uses the ExchangePublicFolder, a MAPI-based data collector. Therefore, it requires both Access Analyzer MAPI CDO and Microsoft Exchange MAPI CDO to be installed on the Access Analyzer Console server. Once these have been installed, the __Settings__ > __Exchange__ node must be configured for proper connection to the Exchange server. See the [Exchange](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/settings/exchange.md) topic for additional information.
