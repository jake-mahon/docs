The following analysis tasks are selected by default:

- 1. Identify Selected Shares – Creates the SA\_FS\_ShareAudit\_ShareSummary table accessible under the job’s Results node
  - Parameter is blank by default.
  - #UNC parameter must be configured by clicking Analysis Configuration with this task selected then selecting the #UNC table in the SQL Script Editor window and clicking __Edit Table__.
    - This brings up the Edit Table window where the user can manually enter UNC paths of each share to be audited or upload a CSV file containing one row for each share to be audited. See the [SQLscripting Analysis Module](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/analysis/sqlscripting.md) section for additional information.
  - List one shared folder per row, using the format: \\HOST\SHARE.
- 2. Direct Permissions – Creates the SA\_FS\_ShareAudit\_DirectPermissions table accessible under the job’s Results node
- 3. Calculate Effective Access – Creates the SA\_FS\_ShareAudit\_ShareAccess table accessible under the job’s Results node
- 4. Identify Broken Inheritance
  - Creates a temporary table in the database for use by downstream analysis and report generation.
