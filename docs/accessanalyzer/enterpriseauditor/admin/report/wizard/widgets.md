# Widgets Page

The Widgets page of the Report Configuration wizard allows you to configure the tables, charts, and text that form the report.

![Widgets page](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgets.webp)

At the top of the page the selected layout is described. The table contains the available element locations where widgets need to be configured.

![Configure widgets](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgetsconfigure.webp)

To add a new widget to an empty element, click __Configure__ and select the desired widget type from the drop-down menu. The following widgets are available:

- [Grid](#grid)
- [Chart](#chart)
- [Text](#text)

The editor or wizard for the selected widget opens. See the relevant section below for information about configuring it.

![Table with configured widgets](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgetsconfigured.webp)

For configured widgets the table shows the title, type, and data source. You can perform the following actions by selecting a row and clicking the relevant button:

- Configure – Opens the editor for the configured widget
- Clear – Deletes the configured widget from the selected element
- Up / Down – Moves the widget up or down to the next element of the selected layout. If another widget is already configured in the element you are moving it to, the two widgets exchange places.

## Grid

The Grid widget type allows you to configure a table to be displayed on generated reports.

DataSource Options

In order to generate results, a location must first be selected as the source of the data.

- Include all SA nodes data – Select this checkbox to display data from all Access Analyzer data tables
- Show Historical Data – If there is historical data, selecting this option displays all collections. It is keyed off of the Job Runtime column.
- Limit maximum number of displayed rows to [number] – Limits the number of rows of data displayed to less than or equal to the number chosen. By default it is set to __1000__.

  __NOTE:__ Limits that are larger than the default may slow down the run time.

Export CSV Options

You can configure the table to allow the data to be exported as a CSV file.

- Export table data as CSV – Select this option to enable a report’s table section to be exportable as a CSV file from the generated report
  - When it is configured, you can click the __All Data__ button on the table section of the report to save the report as a CSV file. See the [Interactive Grids](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/interactivegrids/overview.md) topic for more information.
- Rows – Limits the amount of rows exported to the CSV file. The default is __Visible__.
  - Visible – Only includes the amount of rows set by the __Limit Maximum number of displayed rows to__ option in the DataSource Options section
  - All – Includes all rows of the data set
- Columns – Limits the amount of columns exported to the CSV file. The default is __Visible__.
  - Visible – Only exports the visible columns (excludes any columns removed using the Column Chooser)
  - All – Includes all columns, including those in the Column Chooser

### Table Properties

The Table Properties section allows you to configure the display features of the grid.

![Table Properties section](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgetgridtableproperties.webp)

There are two types of grid displays:

- Interactive grid – Allows the viewer to interact with the table in the generated report. See the [Interactive Grids](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/interactivegrids/overview.md) topic for additional information.
- Non Interactive grid – Creates a report with fixed settings and stationary elements. This option disables all the fields within the Table Properties section.

  __NOTE:__ In order to view user configured Grouping in emailed reports, the report must be emailed as a __Non Interactive Grid__.

The following settings are available when Interactive grid is selected:

Grid Properties

- Treat interactive grid contents as plain text (not HTML) – Enables interactive grid functionality. This option is selected by default.
- Enable Paging – Enables Paging in reports. Paging allows users to interact with large sets of data more efficiently when viewing, filtering, and sorting generated report tables by limiting the amount of data being displayed at a given time. Paging is enabled by default. See the [Paging](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/interactivegrids/paging.md) topic for additional information.

Column Properties

- Group Column – Arranges the table to be grouped by the attributes of the selected column

  __NOTE:__ Paging and grouping are not compatible. When Paging is enabled, the Grouping options are disabled in the Table Properties section and in the generated report.
- Enum Column – Groups the data in tables based on the selected column
- Color Column – Colors a column data displayed on the report’s table section
- Icon Column – Creates an icon that appears next to column name on the report’s table section
- Path Column – Creates a column that displays the attack path within the report

### Data

The selected data for the table is shown in the section at the bottom of the window. This section allows you to configure the data to be displayed in the table.

![Data display](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/widgetgriddata.webp)

The buttons above the column names provide you options for configuring the table arrangement.

- Clear Sorting – Restores columns to the default placement
- Column Chooser – Opens a pane where you can remove unwanted columns or add hidden columns
- Filter Editor – Opens the Filter Editor which allows you to add custom filters with conditional statements and logical connectives
- Best Fit (all columns) –  Adjusts the width of the columns to display all the data within the cells

## Chart

Chart widgets allow you to create various chart types to represent data. A Chart Section can only display one chart type at a time. Charts are configured using the Chart Configuration wizard. See the [Chart Configuration Wizard](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/chartwizard/overview.md) topic for additional information.

## Text

There are two types of text editor that allow you to configure a text element on a report.

- Basic Text Editor – Provides basic functionality like font size and style. Works with HTML script.
- Advanced Text Editor – Provides advanced functionality like document formatting, inserting tables, and adding hyperlinks

![Text Editor selection window](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/report/wizard/texteditorselection.webp)

When you first configure a new text element, a dialog displays allowing you to select the type of Text Editor. On this dialog, select either the Basic or Advanced Text Editor and click __Open Editor__. The selected editor then opens.

__NOTE:__ Once a Text Editor is selected for a Text element, it cannot be changed.
