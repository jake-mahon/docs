# Rename List

Use the Rename List option to change the name of a selected host list. This option is available only
from an individual host list node.

**CAUTION:** Changing the name on a host list that has been assigned to a job can cause the job to
fail.

Select the host list to rename and click **Rename List** to open the Host list name window. Enter
the new name for the host list and click **OK**.

**NOTE:** Host list names can also be changed using the **Edit List** option, see the
[Edit List](editlist.md) topic for additional information.
