# DropboxAccess Data Collector

The DropboxAccess Data Collector audits access, group membership, and content within a Dropbox environment. Dropbox can scan the contents of over 400 file types to discover which files contain sensitive data using Sensitive Data Discovery. The DropboxAccess Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Dropbox Solution. Both this data collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the [Dropbox Solution](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/solutions/dropbox/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Sensitive Data Discovery Considerations

If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host. For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time , then an extra 16 GB of RAM are required (8x2=16).
