# Unix Data Collector

The Unix Data collector provides host inventory, software inventory, and logical volume inventory on UNIX & Linux platforms. The Unix Data Collector has been preconfigured within the Unix Solution. Both this data collector and the solution are available with a special Access Analyzer license. See the [Unix Solution](../../../solutions/unix/overview.md) topic for additional information.

Protocols

- SSH

Ports

- TCP 22
- User configurable

Permissions

- Root permissions in Unix/Linux

If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the [Least Privilege Model](../../../requirements/target/unix.md#least-privilege-model) topic additional information.

## Unix Query Configuration

The Unix Data Collector is configured through the Unix Data Collector Wizard. It is designed to scan and import information from UNIX / Linux systems. The Unix Data Collector has these pages:

- [Unix: Settings](settings.md)
- [Unix: Input](input.md)
- [Unix: Edit Script](editscript.md)
- [Unix: Parsing](parsing.md)
- [Unix: Results](results.md)
