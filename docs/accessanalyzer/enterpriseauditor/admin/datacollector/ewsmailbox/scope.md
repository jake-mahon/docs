# EWSMailbox: Scope

The Mailbox scope settings page is used to select which mailboxes are searched by the scan. It is a wizard page for all categories.

Select an option to specify which mailboxes are searched:

- All mailboxes – Search all mailboxes
- Select mailboxes from list – Search only specific selected mailboxes. This option enables the [EWSMailbox: Scope Select](/docs/accessanalyzer/enterpriseauditor/admin/datacollector/ewsmailbox/scopeselect.md) page.
