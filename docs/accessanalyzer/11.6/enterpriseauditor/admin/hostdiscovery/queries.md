- Query State – Displays the query’s current status (active or idle)
- Last count – Identifies the number of hosts found from the last scan
- Last Queried – Displays the date and time stamp for the last running of the query
- Connection Profile – Identifies the Connection Profile assigned to the query for access to the
  Query Source
- ID – GUID of the query task
- SANode – Name of the Enterprise Auditor Console server
- Snapshot mode – Identifies the type of discovery query:
