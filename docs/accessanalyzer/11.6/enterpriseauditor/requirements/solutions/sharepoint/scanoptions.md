# SharePoint Scan Options

Required permissions on the targeted SharePoint environment are dependent upon not only the type of
environment targeted but also the type of data collection scan being executed. There are two types
of Access Auditing (SPAA) and/or Sensitive Data Discovery Auditing scans: agent-based and
agent-less. The Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans run as agent-less scans from Enterprise Auditor, but
they require the Netwrix Activity Monitor to have an activity agent deployed in the target
environment.

## Agent-Based Type

When Enterprise Auditor SharePoint scans are run in agent-based mode, the Enterprise Auditor
SharePoint Agent must be installed on the SharePoint Application server which hosts the Central
Administration component prior to executing the scans. This is typically the first server stood up
during the SharePoint farm installation process in this mode. The data collection processing is
conducted by the SharePoint Agent for the target environment. The final step in data collection is
to transfer the data collected in the SQLite databases, or Tier 2 databases, on the Enterprise
Auditor SharePoint Agent server back to the Enterprise Auditor Console server.

**NOTE:** Agent-based scans can only target on-premise environments.

- [SharePoint Agent Ports](/versioned_docs/enterpriseauditor_11.6/enterpriseauditor/requirements/solutions/sharepoint/agentports.md)

## Agent-Less Type

When SharePoint agent-less scans are run, it means all of the data collection processing is
conducted by the Enterprise Auditor Console server across the network.

**NOTE:** Agent-less scans can target both on-premise and online environments. This is the only scan
mode that can run Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans.

For Activity Auditing (SPAC) scans, target the server where the Netwrix Activity Monitor has a
deployed activity agent.
