# WMICollector: Classes

On the Classes page, configure the WMICollector namespaces and classes to use as a data source.

![WMI Browser wizard Classes page](/img/versioned_docs/accessanalyzer_11.6/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/wmicollector/classes.webp)

Select the **Namespace** and **Class** from the drop-down lists to use as a data source. The default
namespace, **root\CIMV2**, is typically what should be used. Select the **Win32 classes only**
checkbox to use only Win32 classes.
