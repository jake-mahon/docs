# How to add Devices when serial numbers contain extra characters in the device instance path

## Problem

Some USB devices have trailing extra characters such as &000000 in their serial number when viewed within the Device instance path.

Example

```
SCSI\Disk&Ven__USB&Prod__SanDisk_3.2Gen1\6&1262c329&0&000000
```
When copying these instance paths to create a policy for this device, the serial numbers are not correctly applied in the MMC console view.

This would not properly target the USB device in question as the serial is configured as **0** in the policy.

## Workaround

Instead of adding the Device Instance Path **As Serial Number**, use **As Instance Path** instead.

## Result

This will result in a configuration that will use the entire Device Instance Path as a whole, instead of trying to break out the individual parts and force the targeted USB device to get the permissions as configured in the policy.

The Device Manager policy now works as expected.
