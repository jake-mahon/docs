# Single Sign On (SSO) Conﬁguration with Okta

Single Sign On (SSO) is a powerful authentication process that enhances security and improves user
experience by allowing users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials.
In this guide, we focus on configuring SSO using Okta, a leading identity management service, to
streamline user access and secure your system effectively.

## Configuring SSO with Okta

Configuring Single Sign-On with Okta involves several key steps that integrate your server with
Okta’s authentication framework. Begin by activating SSO within your system’s configuration
settings, selecting a failover user, and preparing for provider selection. This section will guide
you through the precise steps required to establish a secure and efficient SSO connection, including
application integration in Okta, SAML settings configuration, and the necessary data synchronization
between your server and Okta. Follow the steps below to ensure a successful setup.

**Step 1 –** To activate Single Sign-On, navigate to **System Configuration** > **System
Settings** > **Single Sign-On**. Once activated, select a Failover Login User from the drop-down
menu. The Root user is selected by default.
