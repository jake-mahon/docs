# VMware

VMware Tools support a variety of formats such as OVF, OVA, and VMX for deploying the Endpoint
Protector Virtual Appliance. This section provides the necessary guidance to implement the solution
using different virtualization tools available within the VMware suite.

## Implement Using OVF Format

Leverage the OVF format to efficiently deploy your Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance across
supported platforms.

### VMware vSphere

VMware vSphere allows you to deploy virtual appliances efficiently using the OVF format.

Follow the steps to set up your virtual machine.

**Step 1 –** Unzip the downloaded package.

**Step 2 –** Start vSphere.

### VMware Workstation

VMware Workstation provides strong virtualization capabilities for deploying Endpoint Protector
using the OVF format.

Follow the steps to get started with setting up your appliance.

**Step 1 –** Extract the downloaded Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance package and move the ﬁles
to the path where your virtual machines are stored.

**Step 2 –** Open VMWare Workstation.

The Virtual Machine is started and ready for use.

## Implement Using VMX Format

Utilize the VMX format to integrate existing virtual machines into your VMware environment.

### VMware Server

In VMware Server environments, the VMX format facilitates the addition of existing virtual machines
to your inventory. Follow the steps below to get started.

**Step 1 –** Extract the downloaded Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance package and move the ﬁles
to the path where your virtual machines are stored.

**Step 2 –** Open your VMware Server web interface and log in.

At this point, the Virtual Machine is ready to be started.

### VMware Player

VMware Player supports legacy VMX formats, enabling straightforward virtual machine setup. Follow
the steps below to get started on integrating your appliance.

**Step 1 –** Extract the downloaded Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance package and move the ﬁles
to the path where your virtual machines are stored.

**Step 2 –** Open VMware Player.

![Opening VMware Player](/img/product_docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4/install/vmwareplayer.webp)

**Step 3 –** Select **Open a Virtual Machine** and select the VMX ﬁle from the location where you
extracted it and then click **Open**.

![Selecting the VMX ﬁle from the location where it was extracted](/img/product_docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4/install/vmwareopenvm.webp)

**Step 4 –** After the Virtual Machine is in your inventory click **Play Virtual Machine**.

**Step 5 –** If asked if the Virtual Machine was copied or moved, select **I moved it** (if it is
the only Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance in your network).

![Select I moved it](/img/product_docs/endpointprotector/5.9.4/install/vmwaremoved.webp)

At this point, the Virtual Machine is ready to be started.

**CAUTION:** Do not suspend the VMware Player while Endpoint Protector Virtual Appliance is running.

**CAUTION:** Do not shut down your computer while VMware Player is running.
