# Launching the EC2 Image

As the Endpoint Protector image has already been shared with you, this process is similar to any
other EC2 launch.

Follow the steps to launch the EC2 image.

**Step 1 –** Go to Services: EC2 and select your region.

**Step 2 –** Go to Images: AMIs and select the type of the Private image and search for Endpoint
Protector.

**Step 4 –** Enter the Name and Create tags as per your policies.

**Step 5 –** Select an Instance Type.

**NOTE:** For assistance in selecting the instance type that best suits your needs, customers should
submit a support ticket through the
[Netwrix Customer Portal](https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_products.html).

**Step 6 –** Select an available key pair or create a new key pair.

If you choose to use a key pair, you may need to share it with our Support Team for certain support
requests. Ensure that the key pair is used exclusively for this instance to maintain security. We
recommend selecting **Proceed without a Key Pair** and then clicking **Launch Instances**.
