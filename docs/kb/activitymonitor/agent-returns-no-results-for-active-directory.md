# Agent Returns No Results for Active Directory

## Symptom

You have encountered the following `Cannot Find Process` error in the Netwrix Threat Prevention logs:

```text
Failed loading monitor dll:
C:\Program Files\STEALTHbits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent\SI.ActiveDirectoryMonitor.dll, status: CannotFindProcess
```

When attempting to create a dump of `LSASS.exe` via Task Manager on the affected domain controller, it fails or creates a 0-kb file. If the dump creation succeeds, it does not indicate that `SIWindowsAgent.exe` is not blocked, only that `Taskmgr.exe` is allowed to access `LSASS.exe`.

## Cause

Endpoint protection is hiding the `LSASS.exe` process from `SIWindowsagent.exe` or otherwise blocking the hook into the LSASS API. Common EPP solutions include CarbonBlack, Cylance, and CrowdStrike.

## Resolution

In the endpoint protection configuration, allow `SIWindowsAgent.exe` and the contents of the SIAgent install directory access to `LSASS.exe`. Refer to the following default folder:

```text
C:\Program Files\STEALTHBits\StealthINTERCEPT\SIWindowsAgent
```
