2. Click the **Install** button to continue the upgrade. You will confirm the version you’re upgrading to in the next window.
3. Confirm the version and click **Next**.
4. Read the EULA, check the **I accept the terms of the License Agreement** checkbox and click **Next**.
5. Click **Install**. Once the installation process is complete, you should see the confirmation.
6. Congratulations, you have successfully upgraded!

## Post Upgrade

Upon completion, Netwrix Auditor will launch. To confirm integrity, run the following tests:

- **Configuration:** View your Monitoring Plans and settings to confirm the configuration successfully carried over.
- **SQL Connectivity:** On the homepage click **Search** and run a search with your desired parameters. If data is returned, SQL connectivity is validated.
- **SSRS Connectivity:** On the homepage click **Reports** and attempt to view a report for a data source that you are currently auditing. If the report successfully builds, SSRS connectivity is validated.
- **Legacy Steps:** On version 8.5 and lower, you will need to launch the Netwrix Auditor Administrator Console and manually upgrade the Audit Databases in SQL.
  - Click **Audit Database** and then click **Upgrade**.
