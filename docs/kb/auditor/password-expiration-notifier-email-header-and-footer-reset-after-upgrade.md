## Symptoms

They were previously disabled as per the following article: /docs/kb/auditor/hide_and_disable_header_and_footer_in_password_expiration_notifier_emails (Hide and Disable Header and Footer in Password Expiration Notifier Emails).

## Resolution

1. Open Registry Editor on the Netwrix Auditor server host.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Netwrix Auditor`.
3. Right-click the **Netwrix Auditor** hive and click **New**.
4. Select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
5. Name the key `HideEmailAdditionalInfo`.
6. Right-click the key and select **Modify**.
7. Set the value data to `1` (Hexadecimal).
