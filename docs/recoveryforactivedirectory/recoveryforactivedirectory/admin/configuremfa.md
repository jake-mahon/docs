# Configure Multi-Factor Authentication

You can configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your Recovery for Active Directory account to add an additional layer of security when signing into the application.

__NOTE:__ At present, only authenticator apps are supported for MFA. As a prerequisite to enabling MFA, install an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, on your phone.

__Step 3 –__ Open the authenticator app on your phone and scan the QR code with it. A new account is created in the app for the Recovery application and a verification code is displayed under the account name.

__Step 4 –__ Enter this code in the Verification Code field on the Configure authenticator app page and click __Verify__. A confirmation message is displayed on success.

The authenticator app generates a new code every 30 seconds, with each code expiring after 30 seconds.

__Step 5 –__ Click __Close__.

MFA has been enabled for your account. Now you must authenticate your account using the Authenticator app every time you sign into Recovery for Active Directory. See the [Sign In](../install/login.md#sign-in) topic for additional information.
