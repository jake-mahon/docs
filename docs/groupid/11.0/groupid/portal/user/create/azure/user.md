# Create a Microsoft Entra ID User

In GroupID portal, you can create mail-enabled and non mail-enabled users.

NOTE: In a Microsoft Entra ID based identity store, users can only be created as non mail-enabled.
Create a mailbox as an alternative to a mail-enabled user.

NOTE: Pages and fields on the Create User wizard may vary from those discussed here, since the
administrator can customize the wizard by adding or removing pages and fields.
