## View the Deployment Settings for an Instance

While deploying a portal instance in Docker, you have to specify:

- the port for the host machine to map the container to host ports  
  This is the port the application runs on.
- the service URL for communicating with Docker Engine

After instance creation, this info cannot be changed.

**To view the info:**

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal card displays its info, including all its instances.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Click **Deployments** under **Server Settings**.
4. On the **Deployment Settings** page, click the **Docker** tab.
5. On the **Docker** tab, the **Select Application Deployment** drop-down list displays all
   instances of the portal deployed in Docker.  
   On selecting an instance, it’s port, service URL, and the URL to launch the instance is displayed
   on the **Deployment Configurations** tab.
