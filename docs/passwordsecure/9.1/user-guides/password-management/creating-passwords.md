# Creating new passwords

## What does creating new passwords/records mean?

Saving a record/password stores information in the MSSQL database. This process is started in the
Passwords module for the client. It is accessed either via the icon in the ribbon, using the
keyboard shortcut "CTRL + N" or via the context menu that is accessed using the right mouse button
in list view. The next step is to select a suitable form that will open in a modal window.

## Requirements

The following 2 user rights are required:

- Can add new passwords
- Display password module

## Selecting a form

When creating a new record, it is possible to select from all the forms for which the logged-in user
has the required permissions. To make the selection process as easy as possible, a preview of the
form fields included in the form is shown on the right hand side.

![Select form](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/creating_new_passwords_1-en.webp)

In this example, you can see that the "Password" form marked on the left contains three form fields
"Name", "User name" and "Password". Forms thus act as **templates** according to which their
information is saved. (Management of the forms including issuing permissions and editing existing
forms is covered in a separate section)

## Entering data

The window for creating a new record always open in a separate tab. As can be seen below, the
corresponding form fields for the previously selected form can now be filled. Password fields
deserve special mention here because they can be handled differently based on password rules. The
record can be saved via the ribbon when all fields have been filled.

![new record](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/creating_new_passwords_2-en.webp)

## Validity and tags

Irrespective of the selected form, it is always possible to define the validity and tags for a
record. Both values are optional.

![Validity and tags](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/creating_new_passwords_3-en.webp)

- The **validity** defines an end date until which the record is valid. This information can be
  evaluated e.g. in the logbook or in reports. It is thus possible to create a list of all expired
  passwords for a user or an authorized entity. However, it is not possible to limit the usability
  of expired passwords for security reasons.
- **Tags** are freely definable properties of records that can be used as search criteria. This also
  allows thematically linked information to be grouped together.

## Setting permissions for new records

In principle, there are various approaches for setting permissions for newly created records. All of
them have already been described in the Authorization concept section. It is important to note here
that **manual setting of permissions is only possible after saving** a record. Automatic permissions
are set before the record is saved. In this context, the selection of the organisational structure
and the permissions for a record are important aspects.

![permissions new record](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/creating_new_passwords_4-en.webp)

- **Manual setting of permissions**: If you want to manually set permissions for the record, select
  the organisational structure in which the record should be saved. After saving the record, the
  permissions can be manually amended via the permissions tab in the ribbon. If you only want to
  create a personal record for which no other user will receive permissions, simply select your own
  organisational structure and conclude the process with "save" via the ribbon.

NOTE: If any kind of automatic permissions have been activated for the selected OU, this will always
be prioritized.

**CAUTION:** Even when creating private records, inheritance of permissions based on the logged-in
user can also be activated as an option. This option is described in a separate section.

NOTE: The user right Allow sharing of personal passwords can be used to define that personal
passwords cannot be released to other users.

**Automatic setting of permissions**: Automatic setting of permissions is carried out before the
record is saved. Irrespective of whether predefined rights or rights inheritance is being used, the
configuration is always carried out in the organisational structure or permissions area. Saving the
record thus completes the process for creating the password including the issuing of permissions.

# Passwords

## What are passwords?

In Netwrix Password Secure v8, the data record with the passwords represents the central data
object. The Passwords module provides administrators and users with central access to the passwords
for the purpose of handling this sensitive data that requires protection. Search filters in
combination with color-highlighted tags enable very focussed work. Various approaches can be used to
help apply the desired permissions to objects. Furthermore, the ergonomic structure of the module
helps all users to use Netwrix Password Secure in an efficient and targeted manner.

![Password modul](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/passwords_1-en.webp)

## Prerequisite

The following user right is required for adding new passwords:

- **Can add new passwords**

## Module-specific ribbon functions

The ribbon offers access to all possible actions relevant to the situation at all times. Especially
within the "Passwords" module, the ribbon plays a key role due to the numerous module-specific
functions. General information on the subject of the ribbon is available in the relevant section.
The module-specific ribbon functions will be explained below.

![ribbon functions](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/passwords_2-en.webp)

### New

- **New password**: New passwords can be added via this icon in the ribbon, via the context menu
  that is accessed using the right mouse button and via the shortcut (Ctrl + N). The next step is to
  select a suitable form.
- **Open**: Opens the object marked in list view and provides further information about the record
  in the reading pane.
- **Delete**: Deletes the object marked in list view. A log file entry is created (see logbook).
- **Reveal**: The function **Reveal** can be used for all records that have a password field. The
  passwords in the reading pane will be revealed. In the example, the passwords have been revealed
  and can be hidden again with the **Hide** button.

![hide password](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/passwords_3-en.webp)

### Actions

- **Notifications**: Defining notifications enables a constant flow of information about any type of
  interaction. The issuing of notifications is carried out in the module designed for this purpose.
- **Duplicate**: Duplicating creates an exact copy of the record in a new tab.
- **Move**: Moves the record marked in list view to another organisational structure.
- **Toggle** **Favorite**: The selected record is marked as a favorite. It is possible to switch
  between all records and favorites at any time.
- **Quick view**: A modal window opens for the selected record for 15 seconds and displays all
  available information **including the value of the password**.
- Notifications: A list of all configured notifications

### Permissions

- **Permissions**: The drop-down menu can be used to set both password permissions and also form
  field permissions. This method only allows the manual setting of permissions for data (see

  authorization concept)

- **Password masking**: Masking passwords that need to be protected from unauthorized users is an
  important feature of the security concept in Netwrix Password Secure.
- **Seal**: The multi-eye principle in Netwrix Password Secure is covered in its own section. Seals.

### Clipboard

The clipboard is a key element in the ribbon. This only exists in the "Passwords" module. **Clicking
on the desired form field for a record in the ribbon** will copy it to the clipboard.

![Clipboard](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/passwords_4-en.webp)

The message in the style of the "Balloon Tips" in Windows shows that the password has now been saved
in the clipboard for 300 seconds. (Note: the time until the clipboard is cleared is 60 seconds by
default. In the present case, this has been adjusted via the user settings.)

### Start

Conveniently working with passwords is only possible via the efficient usage of automated accesses
via RDP, SSH, general Windows applications or websites. This makes it possible to dispense with
(unsecure) entries via "copy & paste".

- **Open web page**: If an URL is saved in the record, this menu option can be used to directly open
  it.
- **Applications**: If applications have been linked to records, they can be directly opened via the
  "start menu".

### Extras

- **Create external link**: This option creates an external link for the record marked in list view.
  A number of different options can be selected:

![external link](/img/versioned_docs/passwordsecure_9.1/passwordsecure/configuration/advanced_view/clientmodule/passwords/passwords_5-en.webp)

**CAUTION:** If several sessions are opened on a client, an external link is always called in the
first session.

- **History**: This icon opens the history for those records selected in list view in a new tab. Due
  to the comprehensive recording of historical versions of passwords, it is now possible to compare
  several versions with one another.
- **Print**: This option can be used to open the print function.
- **Export**: It is possible to export all the selected records and also the data defined by the
  filter to a .csv file.
- **Change form**: It is possible to change the form used for individual records. "Mapping" of the
  previous form fields can be directly carried out in the process.
- **Settings**: The password settings are described in a separate section.

NOTE: The password module is based on the module of the same name in the Web Application. Both
modules have a different scope and design. However, they are almost identical to use.
