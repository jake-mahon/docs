**Step 2 –** On the Select Resource page, locate the desired resources using the Search Catalog and
browse options.

- Search Catalog – Begin typing the name of the resource:

  - For File System, enter a share name or UNC path (starting with `\\`)
  - For SharePoint, enter the site URL (`http://`)
  - For groups and distribution lists, enter the group name. To focus on a particular domain or
    filter the search field to groups which reside in a particular domain, enter the domain name.

  _Remember,_ it is possible that the resource may not be managed by the Access Information
  Center. Contact the Request Administrator if the desired resource does not come up with search
  filters.

- Browse option – Navigate through the table to select the desired resource. The table will display
  the following information:

  - Resource Name – The icon indicates the type of resource. The resource name includes its
    location, such as the UNC path for a file system resource, the URL for SharePoint resource, or
    Group name (e.g., [Domain]\[Group]).
  - Access – Level of access currently possessed. A green plus symbol indicates multiple access
    levels are available. Possible values include:

    - For file system and SharePoint resources: Full Control, Modify, or Read
    - For groups and distribution lists: Membership

  - Granted – Indicates your current access
  - Description – Resource description as provided by the resource owner

  **NOTE:** When there are more than 100 rows of resources available for access request, this page
  will only load 100 rows of data. You will be able to search for a specific resource that is not
  showing in the current view.

**Step 3 –** Select the resource in the table. If there are multiple access levels available, as
indicated by the green plus (+) button, click the button to rotate through and select the desired
access level. Multiple resources can be selected using ether the Ctrl or Shift key with mouse click
combinations. Click **Add** to place a selected resource into your list.

**Step 6 –** On the Add Notes page, enter the following information:

- The reason for the request — This is included in the notification sent to the owner. The owner may
  decline the request if the reason is unknown.
- Temporary Access — _(Optional)_ If only temporary access is required, select the checkbox, click
  **Set Date** and select an expiration date. The owner of the resource can modify this date.

  **NOTE:** When a user has temporary access already granted to a resource, and then requests a
  different type of access to the same resource with a different expiration date, once the new
  access is granted, the new expiration date supersedes the old date.

**Step 7 –** Click **Next** and the Access Information Center starts the action.
