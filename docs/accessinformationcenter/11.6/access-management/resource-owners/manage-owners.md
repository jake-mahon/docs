# Add New Resource Wizard

The Add new resource wizard is opened with the **Add** button in the Resource Owners interface.

![Add new resource wizard page showing 1. Select Resources page](/img/versioned_docs/auditor_10.6/access/reviews/resourceowners/wizard/selectresource.webp)

It contains five pages:

- 1. Select Resource — Select the resource or group to be managed by the owner
- 2. Select Owners — Select Owners from Active Directory
- 3. Description — Optionally enter a note describing the resource
- 4. Access Groups — Optionally enable Access Requests and Owner Ad Hoc changes for this resource.
     When File System or SharePoint resources will be managed through the AIC, it is necessary to
     configure access groups for those resources in the target environment. An access group
     provides one of the following access levels to a specific resource: Read, Modify, or Full
     Control.

  **NOTE:** This feature requires the Access Information Center is to be configured to commit
  changes in Active Directory. Additionally, resource based groups must be set up on the resource.
  See the
  [Commit Active Directory Changes](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/resource-audit/change-modeling/commit-changes.md) topic

     Information Center and the assigned owner. A preview of the selected file displays on this
     page.
- 2. Options — Provides the option for marking all imported resources as having confirmed
     ownership. If the CSV file only contains Groups, you can additionally select to enable Access
     Requests and Owner Ad Hoc changes for them.

The CSV file should list one resource per row using the following format:

[ResourcePath],[Owner1];[Owner2];[Owner3],[Description]

![Example CSV File showing file system, SharePoint, and group resource formats](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/wizard/csvfileformat.webp)

- Resource Formats:

  - File System Resources – Resource path should be the UNC path to the share or folder.

    \\ExampleServer\ExampleShare,ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner

  - SharePoint Resources – Resource path should be the URL to the site resource.

    http://ExampleFarm/ExampleSiteCollection/ExampleSite,ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner

  - Groups – Resource path should be the NTAccount [DOMAIN\NAME] for the group or distribution
    list

    ExampleDomain\ExampleGroup,ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner

- Multiple owners can be added, separated by a semicolon (;)

  ExampleDomain\ExampleGroup,ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner1;ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner2

- _(Optional)_ A description for the resource can be added after the last owner

  ExampleDomain\ExampleGroup,ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner1;ExampleDomain\ExampleOwner2,Security
  group for access to the Example share

_Remember,_ if the CSV file contains resources other than just Groups, this method only imports
resources with owners. It will be necessary to update each resource to enable Access Requests and
Owner Ad Hoc changes. See the

# Add Owner Window

The Add Owner window opens from either the
[Add New Resource Wizard](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access-management/resource-owners/manage-owners.md)
or the
[Update Resource Wizard](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access-management/resource-owners/manage-owners.md).
Choose between:

- [Select a Probable Owner](#select-a-probable-owner) — Select from a calculated list of probable
  owners
- [Search for Owner](#search-for-owner) — Browsing Active Directory for a user account

## Select a Probable Owner

![Add Owner window showing Probable Owner option](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/window/addownerprobable.webp)

Probable owners are calculated from the available data:

- For File System and SharePoint resources

  - Common Managers – Calculated by looking at the users who have created content within the
    resource and their manager as defined in Active Directory
  - Content Owners – Calculated by looking at the users who have created content within the
    resource
  - Active Users – Calculated by looking at the users who have performed activity within the
    resource as identified by Enterprise Auditor activity audits

- For groups

  - Administrators – Calculated by looking at the Managed By property for the selected group
  - Common Managers – Calculated by looking at the Manager property for the users within the
    selected group

**NOTE:** The Probable Owner categories may or may not be populated with options. For File System or
SharePoint resources, it depends on content and activity data which has been collected by Enterprise
Auditor. If no content or activity information exists, no owner will be recommended. For Active
Directory resources, it depends on the Managed By property for groups and the Manager property for
users to be set within Active Directory. If these properties are blank, no owner will be
recommended.

Select the desired owner from the list and click **OK**. The Add Owner window closes and the
selected user appears in the Owner list.

## Search for Owner

![Add Owner window showing Search option](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/window/addownersearch.webp)

Enter a name in the search field to find and select users from Active Directory, which populates in
a drop-down menu as you type. If multiple domains are known to the application, ensure the correct
domain is selected from the drop-down menu. Click **OK** and the Add Owner window closes. The
selected user appears in the Owner list.

# Confirm Removal Window

The process of removing a resource from the Resource Owners interface disassociates the owner(s)
from the resource, it does not remove the resource from the database or from the available reports.
Any history of actions performed by the owner for that resource will be maintained, but pending
actions will be canceled. Pending actions may include outstanding reviews or access requests.

Follow the steps to remove a resource from being managed through the application.

**Step 1 –** In the Resource Owners interface, select the resource and click Remove. The Confirm
Removal window opens.

![Confirm Removal window asking are you sure you wish to remove](/img/versioned_docs/threatprevention_7.4/threatprevention/admin/configuration/collectionmanager/confirmremoval.webp)

**Step 2 –** Click Yes to complete the removal process or **No** to cancel it.

The resource no longer appears in the Resource Owners interface.

# Select Group Window

The Select Group window opens from either the
[Add New Resource Wizard](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access-management/resource-owners/manage-owners.md)
or the
[Update Resource Wizard](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/access-management/resource-owners/manage-owners.md).

![Select Group window](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/window/selectgroup.webp)

The window displays groups with the selected access level for this resource. If there are no groups
displayed, then it will be necessary to create a group and grant it this level of access to the
selected resource. Do not forget to run the Enterprise Auditor collection jobs to introduce the new
group to the Access Information Center. Select the desired group and click **OK**. The Select Group
window closes and the group appears in the table for the wizard.

# Ownership Confirmation

The reason for assigning owners to resources is to enable business data owners to manage access to
those resources without requiring IT Administrative privileges. In order for this to work, the
assigned owner needs to claim that ownership responsibility. Resources that do not have confirmed
owners may fall through the cracks.

**NOTE:** This requires the Notification settings to be configured for the Access Information
Center. See the
[Notifications Page](/docs/accessinformationcenter/11.6/administration/configuration/notifications.md)
topic for additional information.

![Status Column in Resource Owners interface](/img/versioned_docs/accessinformationcenter_11.6/access/informationcenter/resourceowners/ownershipconfirmation.webp)

The table in the Resource Owners interface includes a Status column. The following icons appear in
this column to indicate confirmation status:
