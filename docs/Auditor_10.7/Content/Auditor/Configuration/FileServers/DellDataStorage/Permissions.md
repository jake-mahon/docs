Dell VNX, VNXe, Celerra, and Unity NAS devices are collectively referred to as Dell Data Storage.

Before you start creating a monitoring plan to audit your Dell VNX/VNXe/Unity file storage system, plan for the account that will be used for data collection – it should meet the requirements listed below. Then you will provide this account in the monitoring plan wizard.

**On the target server:**

1. The account must be a member of the local Administrators group.
2. The account requires **Read** permissions on the audited shared folders.
