# Configuring Tagging

For a SharePoint source, tagging means the automatic population of
[managed metadata fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/managed-metadata) with
classification attributes from **SharePoint Term Sets** that were registered as taxonomies within
Netwrix Data Classification.

To configure tagging for your SharePoint source, you should first check the prerequisites and take
preparatory steps described below. Then you will be able to launch a specially designed SharePoint
Tagging Wizard.

To check the prerequisites

1. Make sure you have set up the necessary term sets as described in
   [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/set-up-new-term-set).
2. Configure one or more managed metadata columns with the libraries that you plan to apply
   auto-classification to. See
   [this Microsoft article](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/create-a-managed-metadata-column-8fad9e35-a618-4400-b3c7-46f02785d27f)
   for details.
3. Ensure that the desired term sets are registered as taxonomies within the Netwrix Data
   Classification console. See **Importing Taxonomies - SharePoint** section in Search and Filter
   Taxonomies for details.
4. Ensure that the appropriate SharePoint product is installed in your SharePoint environment
   (typically, the provider-hosted add-In named _conceptClassifierApp_; see the procedure below for
   details).  
   This add-on provides a specially designed Wizard that assigns taxonomies to Content Types in
   SharePoint. It also creates the necessary event handlers to keep the classification up to date as
   new documents are added and existing documents are edited.

To configure tagging using the wizard

1. Click on the app to start the **SharePoint Tagging wizard**.

![sharepoint_tagging_wizard_1_thumb_0_0](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/sources/sharepoint_tagging_wizard_1_thumb_0_0.webp)

2. Configure the Term Sets that you wish to auto-classify. For that, click the **Add** button and
   then select the required Term Sets or fields:

   ![sharepoint_tagging_wizard_2_thumb_0_0](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/sources/sharepoint_tagging_wizard_2_thumb_0_0.webp)

3. If needed, select the specific site/list columns you wish to restrict auto-classification to.
4. Confirm the selection.
5. Finally, having configured the desired tagging, you should re-classify the appropriate content —
   for the tags to be written back to SharePoint.

# Managing list of exclusions

When indexing SharePoint files, you can specify the list of file locations that will be ignored. For
that, in the list of sources, select SharePoint, then select **Settings** →**SharePoint Excluded**
on the left, and click **Add**.

1. On the **Filter** tab, in the **Filter** field specify the objects (files or folders) to exclude:

   To exclude a certain document, enter the page URL with no wildcard indicators (e.g.
   _http://test.sharepoint.com/sites/documents/excluded%20document.docx_

   ![manage_managing_list_of_exclusions](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/sources/manage_managing_list_of_exclusions.webp)

   You can use wildcards anywhere in the exclusion pattern definition as follows:

   - The asterisk character (\*) matching any sequence of characters
   - The question mark character (?) matching any single character

   For example:

   - _http://test.sharepoint.com/sites/documents/\*_ will exclude all documents in the folder
   - _\*/Restricted Folder/\*_ will exclude such folder in any site

**NOTE:** Exclusions are case-insensitive.

2. Optionally, enter full exclusion URL to verify the settings and click **Test**.
3. If needed, you can use metadata conditions to restrict when an exclusion filter should be
   applied. For that, click **Condition** tab and click **Add**. Then select how the exclusion
   conditions will work: it can check if metadata field of the document has any value, is not
   specified, or matches a specific metadata value.

   | Criteria      | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
   | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Comparison    | Compare a value in the document metadata field with the value set by condition. With this criteria selected, you will then need to specify: - **Field name** — document metadata field to check - **Comparison** — operator to use (for example, "does not contain") - **Value** — value to compare against For example, to exclude documents tagged with year 2018, set the condition as follows: - **Field Name** — _DocYear_ - **Comparison** — _equals_ - **Value** — _2018_ |
   | Has any value | Exclude the document if its metadata field has any value. With this criteria selected, specify **Field Name**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
   | Has no values | Exclude the document if metadata field value is not specified. With this criteria selected, specify **Field Name**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

   ![gdrive_exclusion_condition_2_thumb_0_0](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/sources/gdrive_exclusion_condition_2_thumb_0_0.webp)

   When finished, click **Add**.

4. Finally, click **Save** and close the window.

# Content Sources

A _content source_ in terms of Netwrix Data Classification is a repository of data to be crawled and
classified. Each content source has an individual configuration and, where appropriate, credentials.

For adding and managing content sources, use the **Content Configuration**→Sources area of the
Netwrix Data Classification management console.

**IMPORTANT!** To access the **Sources** area, users require sufficient rights. See the
[User Management](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/security-administration/user-management/users-roles.md) section
for more information.

You can manage the individual content sources or organize them into source groups, which are used as
logical containers.

**NOTE:** You can configure the unlimited number of sources to work with.

See next:

- [Add a Content Source](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/data-sources/managing-sources.md)
- Manage Sources
- [Manage Sources and Control Data Processing](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/data-sources/managing-sources.md)

# Manage Sources and Control Data Processing

The following commands are available on the **General** tab of the **Sources** section:

- Delete—Removes the source from processing. Its content will not appear in the search results in
  due course.

**NOTE:** This does not delete content from the external system

- Re-Collect—Queues the source for re-processing. Crawled items will be deleted, and the entire
  source re-crawled
- Re-Index—Queues a source or item to be re-indexed regardless of if the documents were changed or
  not. You can select Re-Index scope:

  - Selected Item(s) and All Descendants — select to Re-Index an Item and child of a child of so
    forth child element.
  - Selected Item(s) and Children — select to Re-Index an Item and its direct child elements.
  - Selected Item(s) Only — select to Re-Index only current item and ignore its child elements.

- Re-Classify—Queues a source or item to be re-classified against the latest configured
  classification rules

**NOTE:** See
[Index Maintenance](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/security-administration/administration/content-cleanup.md) for
more information on these operations.

- Pause—Temporarily pauses source content processing
- Resume—Resumes a source from a temporary pause
- Add To Group—Adds a source to a logical container (Source Group), either an existing or a newly
  created one.

Besides, in the source list on the **General** tab you can do the following for selected source:

- [View Results](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/data-sources/managing-sources.md)
- **Edit** the source details by clicking on the "gear" icon
- **View source-specific statistics** by clicking on the "chart" icon
- **View detailed information** by clicking on the “i” icon
- **Navigate to the source** by clicking on the “link” icon

![sources](/img/versioned_docs/dataclassification_5.6.2/ndc/sources/sources.webp)

**NOTE:** When adding a source or managing source configuration, the most commonly used source
settings are displayed by default. However, some source types have additional configuration options
that can be displayed by clicking the Advanced Settings ("wrench" icon). You can allow these
advanced settings to be always shown to authorized users.
[See Users and Security Settings for more information.](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/security-administration/user-management/users-roles.md)

## Modify Source Settings

To edit configuration settings for the certain source, select the source and go to the corresponding
tab, e.g. **Box** or **SharePoint**. Then you can, in particular, specify **Write configuration**
(i.e. "tagging") settings and apply source-specific parameters. See
[Use Tagging](/docs/dataclassification/5.6.2/data-sources/managing-sources.md) for more information.

# Use Tagging

## Overview

Tagging in Netwrix Data Classification means writing classification attributes back to the content
files. Tagging enables external systems (that is, not directly integrated with Netwrix Data
Classification) to leverage the automatically generated classifications for a variety of business
purposes, for example:

- Enriching the search experience
- Driving the application of DLP/Security labelling
- Enabling external workflow applications
- Applying IT policies to the classified objects

Tagging is designed to work as natively as possible with each source type. Therefore, each
integration varies in the way that classifications can be written, with some overlaps.

Typically, to use tagging, you need to take the following steps:

1. Ensure that an appropriate license has been loaded to enable document tagging. For that, go to
   **System Configuration** →**Config → Licensing → Licensing Summary**.
2. Ensure that the credentials you plan to use for accessing the source system have been granted the
   appropriate **Modify** permissions.
3. Ensure that tagging has been enabled for the source objects— for that, select the **Write
   Classifications** option in the source settings.
4. Configure the source-specific settings to map the classifications results back to the source
   properties, as described in the related section.

**NOTE:** If you are unsure of the correct source specific settings to use, then we recommend
initially working with some sandbox data.

You can **Pause** source processing while you are configuring the correct settings to ensure that no
tagging will occur with partial/incorrect configuration settings.
