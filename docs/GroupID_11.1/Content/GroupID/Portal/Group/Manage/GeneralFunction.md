# General Group functions

2. Select this object on the **Search Results** page and click **Owner** on the toolbar.

A security type is assigned to the group when it is created. However, you can change it later, if required.

   The Groups page is displayed with the **My Groups** tab in view.

3. Select a different security type for the group from the **Security** list.
4. Click **Save**.
