# Prerequisites for Deployments in Docker

To deploy the Directory Manager applications in Docker, make sure you have a running instance of
Docker deamon in your environment.

## Directory Manager Applications for Docker

With every Directory Manager release, images for the following applications are pushed to Directory
Manager’s repository on Docker Hub:

- Directory Manager portal
- Data service
- Security service
- Admin Center

Images are akin to templates. You can pull an application image to Docker deamon and use it to
create a container for that application in Docker. Your application runs within this container.

For example, you can pull a Data service image from Docker Hub to Docker deamon and create a
container to deploy and run the service.

Image as template

Think of an image as a template. Run an image as many times as needed. On every run, a new container
is created in Docker, representing a new deployment of the same application.

## Docker Settings in the Configuration Tool

In Directory Manager, Docker-related configurations are managed using the Configuration Tool. These
include:

- Connectivity with Docker Hub
- Creating the default Data service
- Creating the default Security service

### Specify Repository Info

To connect with Docker Hub, provide the name of the Directory Manager repository on Docker Hub.
Images for the Directory Manager applications are publicly available here:

On pulling an image, you are prompted to provide your Directory Manager license. Enter a valid
license to deploy the application in Docker.

### Service Deployment (Optional)

Using the Configuration Tool, you can choose to deploy the default Data service and Security service
in Docker or native IIS.

To proceed with a Docker deployment, provide a container name, a port number, and the Docker Engine
URL for Data service and then for Security service. The Configuration Tool creates a container for
each service in Docker deamon and runs the service from within that container.

## Images and Containers in Docker Desktop

In Docker Desktop, you can view the images available in the remote repository (Docker Hub), the
images that you have pulled, and the containers created (the applications running in Docker).

### Images

Launch Docker Desktop and click **Images** in the left pane.

![images_-_local_tab](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/images_-_local_tab.webp)

The Images page (Local tab) shows all images that you have pulled from different repositories.
Notice the first image is from Directory Manager. Here:

- **Imanami** is the repository name.
- **gid-selfservice** is the Directory Manager application name.
- **Tag** is the Directory Manager version.

Click **Remote Repositories** to go to the remote server, where you will find all Directory
Manager-specific images under _Imanami_.

![images_-_remote_repositories](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/images_-_remote_repositories.webp)

Directory Manager application images for different Directory Manager versions are listed here. For
example, three Data service images are available for three distinct Directory Manager versions.

Hence, multiple images for an application are available in Docker Hub, each linked to a different
Directory Manager version. Based on the Directory Manager version you install, the corresponding
images will be pulled from Docker Hub and deployed in Docker.

### Containers

On the **Images page – Local** tab, you can manually run an image to create a container for
deploying the application.

Click **Containers/Apps** in the left pane to view the containers.

![apps_page](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/apps_page.webp)

Select a container and click **Inspect** to view its details.

![container_details](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/container_details.webp)

# Prerequisites for Deployments in Remote IIS

To deploy Directory Manager portals and services (Data service and Security service) in remote IIS,
you must set up the following prerequisites:

- Install the required software
- Create a site in remote IIS for deploying the Directory Manager portal and services, and assign
  permissions
- Generate an access key for the Microsoft IIS Administration API

## Prerequisite Software

Before you can deploy Directory Manager portals and services in remote IIS, make sure the following
prerequisite software is installed on the remote IIS machine. Install them in the following order:

1. ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0.30 (Hosting Bundle)  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-6.0.30-windows-hosting-bundle-installer)
   to download.
2. .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.30  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer)
   to download.
3. ASP.NET Core Runtime 2.1.25 (Hosting Bundle)  
   Click [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/2.1) to download.
4. Microsoft IIS Administration 2.3.0  
   Click [here](https://github.com/microsoft/IIS.Administration/releases/tag/v2.3.0) to download.

## Create a Site in Remote IIS

As a prerequisite to deploying a Directory Manager application in remote IIS, you need to create a
site there and assign appropriate permissions to it. Directory Manager portals and services should
be created within this site.

**To create a site in remote IIS:**

1. Launch Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager (see
   [Opening IIS Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/iis/6.0-sdk/ms525920(v=vs.90).
2. In the left pane, right-click **Sites** and select **Add Website**.

   ![Add a website in IIS](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/addsite.webp)

3. Enter the information as shown below and click **OK**:

   ![Add Website window](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/addwebsite.webp)

   1. Enter a name for the site in the **Site name** box.
   2. Create a new folder on the remote machine and bind this site to that folder. Provide the
      physical path of the newly created folder in the **Physical path** box. When you create a
      Directory Manager application in the site, a sub-folder will be created within this folder
      and application files will be copied to it.
   3. Provide binding information in the **Binding** section.

      - Type: HTTPS
      - Port: any available port

   4. Select an SSL certificate from the **SSL certificate** dropdown list.

### Assign Permissions

The next step is to assign permissions on the physical folder that binds to your site in remote IIS.

1. Go to the physical path of your IIS site folder and provide the full control to a local group
   IIS_IUSRS on this folder.  
   To assign these permissions:

   1. Right click the group you created and select **Properties**.
   2. Select the **Security** tab.
   3. Click **Edit**.
   4. Click **Add**.
   5. Click **Locations**.
   6. Select your machine name from the list in the **Locations** box. Click **OK**.
   7. In the **Enter the object names** box type _IIS_IUSRS_ and click the **Check Names** button.
      The group name should appear as follows:

      ```
      `<your machine name>`\IIS_IUSRS
      ```

   8. Click **OK**.
   9. Allow Full Control to _IIS_IUSRS_ group.
   10. Click **Apply** and then click **OK**.
   11. Click **OK** to close the **Permissions for `<folder name>`** dialog box.
   12. Click **OK** to close the **`<folder name>` Properties** dialog box.
   13. The required permissions have been assigned to the folder.

2. After assigning the permissions, go to the following path

   ```
      C:\Program Files\IIS Administration\2.3.0\Microsoft.IIS.Administration\config\
   ```

3. Open the **appsettings.json** file and add the highlighted script at the end of the file:

   ![Script for appsettings.json file](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/appsettings-full.webp)

4. The script to be added is given below:

   ```
      },
      "files": {
          "locations": [
            {
              "alias": "<site_name>",
              "path": "<site_folder_name>",
              "claims": [
                "read",
                "write"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }

   ```

   Remember, to provide values for alias "site name" and path "physical folder location of the
   site", created in the section Create a Site in Remote IIS.

## Generate an Access Key

Admin Center uses the
[Microsoft IIS Administration API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis-administration/) to
communicate with remote IIS. Make sure this API is instphysical folder location of the site",
created in the section Create a Site in Remote IISalled as a Windows service on the remote IIS
machine.

To connect to the API, an access key is required. Follow the steps below to generate it.

1. Go to _https://localhost:55539/_ to launch the Microsoft Administration API interface.  
   Note that this is the default URL. It may change for reasons such as when a different port is
   used.
2. Click **ACCESS KEYS**.

   ![Access Keys](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/requirements/target/config/accesskeys.webp)

3. Click **Create Access Key** to generate an access key and provide the following information:

   ![Access Key Purpose window](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/accesskeyspurpose.webp)

4. On clicking **Create**, the access key is generated.

   ![Access Token window](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/accesstoken.webp)

# Database Requirements

Directory Manager requires an SQL Server database to store and retrieve data. The SQL database may
reside on any SQL Server in your environment.

Directory Manager supports the following versions of SQL Servers:

| Database Servers          | Editions                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft SQL Server 2016 | Express, Standard, Enterprise Express edition available at: [SQL Server 2016 Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56840)  |
| Microsoft SQL Server 2017 | Express, Standard, Enterprise Express edition available at: [SQL Server 2017 Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55994)  |
| Microsoft SQL Server 2019 | Express, Standard, Enterprise Express edition available at: [SQL Server 2019 Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=101064) |
| Microsoft SQL Server 2022 | Express, Standard, Enterprise Express edition available at: [SQL Server 2022 Express edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) |

The SQL Server Browser service is required and during the installation of SQL Server, you can set
its start mode either as Automatic, Disabled or Manual. If it is disabled, SQL Servers are not
listed in the **SQL Server** box on the Database settings page of the Configuration Tool. In that
case, you have to type the server name in the **SQL Server** box to select the required server
manually.

To enable the SQL Server Browser service, see
[How to: Start and Stop the SQL Server Browser Service](<http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189093(v=sql.105).aspx>).

NOTE: Directory Manager now uses .NetCore 8 and it requires a SQL certificate to access database
using Windows Authentication. Therefore, if you want to access the Directory Manager database using
Windows Authentication, then a SQL certificate must be added to the Trusted Root Certification
Authorities certificate store on connecting clients or servers such as Directory Manager. See the
[SQL Certificate for Windows Authentication](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md) topic for additional information.

# Supported Microsoft Exchange Servers

Directory Manager supports the following Microsoft Exchange Servers:

- Microsoft Exchange Server 2013
- Microsoft Exchange Server 2016
- Microsoft Exchange Server 2019

# Hardware Requirements

Minimum hardware requirements for Directory Manager are:

- 1.4 GHz or faster with four or more cores on a 64-bit processor
- 8 GB of RAM in case of Directory Manager-managed Elasticsearch

  6 GB of RAM in case of self-managed Elasticsearch

  RECOMMENDED: We recommend a dedicated server for Directory Manager. If you install any other
  application on the Directory Manager server, then adjust RAM requirements accordingly. For
  example, if you install SQL Server, you may need to add 2-4 GB RAM depending on the edition of
  the SQL Server.

  Different editions of SQL Server have varying resource requirements. For example:

  - SQL Server Express – Minimal resource usage; 2 GB additional RAM may suffice.
  - SQL Server Standard or Enterprise – These require more resources; allocate 4 GB or more
    additional RAM for optimal performance.

- 6 GB or more disk space (for installation only)

  Space requirements are relative to the provider's data size growth for Elasticsearch data.

# Requirements

This page lists the hardware, operating system, MS Exchange, and database required to run Directory
Manager 11.1. The prerequisites may vary depending on your environment.

- [Hardware Requirements](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)
- [Microsoft Windows Servers Requirements ](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)
- [Supported Microsoft Exchange Servers](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)
- [Database Requirements](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)

Prior to installation, the [Preparation Tool](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/installation-guide.md) installs the
required software and Windows features. See the
[What does the Preparation Tool Install](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/installation-guide.md) topic for the list
of components the tool installs.

# Service Account for Active Directory and Exchange

You must have a service account to connect an identity store to an Active Directory domain.
Directory Manager uses the account to access objects in Active Directory. If Microsoft Exchange is
configured as the messaging provider for the identity store, you can also delegate permissions to
this account to access Exchange objects.

You can use an existing account, provided it has the required permissions, or you can create a new
one. Instructions for both options are discussed in the following sections, although it is
recommended that you create a new service account rather than using an existing account.

NOTE: You must add the service account to the membership of the Local Administrator group of the
member server on which Directory Manager is installed.

What do you want to do?

- Use an Existing Account as a Service Account
- Create a New Service Account
- SQL Server Account and Database Permissions

## Use an Existing Account as a Service Account

Verify that the account that you want to use as a service account has the following Active Directory
and Exchange permissions:

Exchange permissions are required if Microsoft Exchange is configured as the messaging provider for
the identity store.

|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active Directory        | Recommended: **Domain Admins** Minimum permissions: - Grant permissions to create and delete users, contacts, and groups. - Grant permissions to modify users, contacts, and groups. See the Create a New Service Account topic for instructions on modifying the service account to grant the required permissions. |

Exchange, when Exchange is configured as the messaging provider for the identity store.

Instructions for delegating permissions for each supported Exchange Server version are as follows.

**For Exchange Server 2013/2016/2019:**

Launch Exchange Management Shell and type the following command:

```
Add-RoleGroupMember "Recipient Management" -Member domain name\user
```

## SQL Server Account and Database Permissions

See the [Authentication Modes](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md) topic for information about the roles and
permissions the SQL server and database accounts must have for
[SQL Server Authentication](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md#sql-server-authentication) mode and for
[Windows Authentication](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md#windows-authentication) mode.

**See Also**

- [Manage an Identity Store](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/configuration/identity-stores.md)

# gMSA for Active Directory

Directory Manager enables you to use a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) to connect an Active
Directory identity store to the identity provider. To ensure that the gMSA can be configured and
used effectively, verify the following:

- General Checks
- Required Permissions
- Allowed Principals

## General Checks

- Run the following cmdlet in Windows PowerShell on the Directory Manager server to verify the gMSA
  status as either _true_ or _false_.

  ```
  Test-ADServiceAccount -Identity <gMSA>
  ```

- In case a gMSA is configured for GroupIDAppPool11 or as a service account for identity store make
  sure the account name follows the format:  
  FQDN\<gMSA>$)

## Required Permissions

- The gMSA must have full permissions on the Directory Manager installation folder.
- It must be a member of the local administrator group (Administrators) on the Directory Manager
  server.
- It must be a member of the local IIS group (IIS_IUSRS) on the Directory Manager server.

## Allowed Principals

- The following principals must be allowed to retrieve the managed password for the gMSA that you
  use to connect an identity store to an identity provider:

  - Directory Manager server (type: Computer)
  - The account configured for the Directory Manager app pool (type: Service Account)

- If any of these principals are not allowed to retrieve the managed password for the gMSA, do the
  following depending on the scenario:

  - If a group is mentioned in the 'PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword' parameter of
    the New-ADServiceAccount cmdlet, add the missing principal (Directory Manager server and/or
    app pool account) to the group.  
    Both these principals must be enlisted directly or indirectly in the
    'PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword' parameter.
  - If an individual principals are mentioned in the 'PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword'
    parameter of the New-ADServiceAccount cmdlet, use the
    'PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword' parameter of the Set-ADServiceAccount cmdlet to
    add the missing principals (Directory Manager server and/or app pool account).

NOTE: Restart the Directory Manager server if you apply any of the above.

**See Also**

- [Manage an Identity Store](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/configuration/identity-stores.md)

# Service Account Permissions

To connect an Active Directory identity store to a domain, you must use a service account with
elevated privileges. You can also use a Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) for this purpose.

See the following topics for details on these accounts:

- [Service Account for Active Directory and Exchange](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)
- [gMSA for Active Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/installation/requirements.md)

# Authentication Modes

While setting up Directory Manager, you must select an authentication mode for connecting to SQL
Server (that hosts the Directory Manager database). There are two possible modes:

- SQL Server Authentication
- Windows Authentication

## SQL Server Authentication

It is recommended that you create a new SQL Server account for Directory Manager. You must add the
account to the _db_creator_ server role so that it can create and maintain the Directory Manager
database.

The account must also be part of the _db_owner_ database role, so that it can execute DDL (Data
Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands. However, unlike Windows
Authentication mode setup, you do not need to add the account to the _db_owner_ role because SQL
Server _db_creator_ is mapped to the _db_owner_ database role by default.

NOTE: Note: For SQL Server 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2022 families, every SQL Server account is assigned
the _public_ role. Therefore, the Directory Manager SQL account belongs to two server roles:
_db_creator_ and _public_.

To add the Directory Manager SQL account to the db_creator role:

Step 1 – Launch SQL Server Management Console.

Step 2 – Create a new account for Directory Manager 11, if needed.

Step 3 – Connect to the server using your new Directory Manager SQL account.

Step 4 – Right-click the database server node and click **Properties**.

Step 5 – On the Properties dialog box, select the **Permissions** page.

Step 6 – Scroll down on the Explicit tab to the Connect SQL permission and select the **Grant**
check box for it.

Step 7 – Click the **Effective** tab. You should have the following permissions listed here:

- Connect SQL
- Create any database
- View any database

Step 8 – Click **OK**.

## Windows Authentication

Directory Manager works with SQL Server (which hosts the Directory Manager database) using the
Windows Authentication mode in context of the account configured in GroupIDAppPool11 (when SQL
Server is available locally or remotely). Directory Manager detects this account and authenticates
with it on SQL Server via Windows authentication.

You can configure a domain account in GroupIDAppPool11 and use it to connect Directory Manager to
SQL Server, provided that it has the following permissions on SQL Server.

- The user account type on SQL Server must be a Windows account with db_owner permissions on the
  Directory Manager database.
- For creating a new database, the user account must have the db_creator role and db_owner
  permissions on the master database.

Use a domain account when SQL Server is available remotely or locally. A local Windows account will
work only when Directory Manager and SQL Server are running on the same machine).

The domain account used to connect Directory Manager with SQL Server must:

- Be a member of the IIS_IUSR and Backup Operators groups.
- Have read/write permissions on the Directory Manager 11 installation folder: [Directory Manager
  installation drive]:\Program Files\Imanami\GroupID 11.0.

# SQL Certificate for Windows Authentication

Directory Manager now uses .NetCore 8 and it requires a SQL certificate to access SQL database using
Windows Authentication. Therefore, if you want to access the Directory Manager database using
Windows Authentication, then a SQL certificate must be added to the Trusted Root Certification
Authorities certificate store on connecting clients or servers such as Directory Manager.

## Generate a certificate for SQL server

Create the certificate on the SQL Server using the following command.

```
New-SelfSignedCertificate-DnsName “SQL Server name” -CertStoreLocation “Cert:LocalMachine\My” -KeySpec KeyExchange
