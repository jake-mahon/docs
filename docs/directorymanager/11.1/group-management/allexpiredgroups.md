# Expired Groups

This page lists expired groups. A group expires when:

- Its validity period, as defined in its expiration policy, ends.

  OR

- The administrator manually designates a group as expired.

Expired groups are locked for all activities until renewed.

You can [Modify Search Directory](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/group-management/allgroups.md#modify-search-directory) to search expired groups and
add [Filter All Groups](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/group-management/allgroups.md#filter-all-groups) by clicking **Expired Group Grid Filters**.
All the expired groups matching the filters will be displayed.
