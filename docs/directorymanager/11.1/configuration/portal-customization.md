# Manage the Bad Words List

Directory Manager enables you to restrict portal users from saving data containing words that might
be offensive. You can maintain a list of undesired words for a portal. When a user enters a value
that contains a word on the list, the portal does not save the entry until the word is removed or
corrected.

The bad words check applies to the following:

- Fields with the ‘Filter Bad Words’ option enabled in field properties
- History notes that a user enters for a logged history action

# Customize the Create Object Wizards

Using a portal, users can create different directory objects, namely:

- User
- Mailbox
- Contact
- Static Group
- Smart Group
- Organizational Dynasty
- Geographical Dynasty
- Managerial Dynasty
- Custom Dynasty

The portal provides a separate wizard for creating each of these objects. You can customize a wizard
as needed.

NOTE: In the portal, the _Create Group_ wizard starts with the _Group Type_ page, where users can
select the type of group they want to create. Options on this page vary, depending on the
permissions assigned to the user in the identity store. (See the
[Security Role – Permissions](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/permissions.md) topic.)

- If a user has the _Create Static Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Smart Group_
  permission, only the _Static Group_ option is displayed on the _Group Type_ page.
- If a user has the _Create Smart Group_ permission and is denied the _Create Static Group_
  permission, all options except _Static Group_ are displayed on the _Group Type_ page.
  ![group_type](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/group_type.webp)

NOTE: You can customize the _Group Type_ page individually for static group, Smart Group, and each
of the Dynasty types. However:

- If a user has permissions to create both static groups and Smart Groups, the _Group Type_ page
  created for _Static Group_ would be displayed to the user in the portal.
- If a user does not have permission to create static groups, but has permission to create Smart
  Groups, the _Group Type_ page created for _Smart Group_ would be displayed to the user in the
  portal for Smart Groups and Dynasties.

# Specify Attributes for Import/Export of Group Owners and Members

In the Directory Manager portal, users can:

- Export members and additional owners of a group to a file, such as a csv or an xls file
- Import members and additional owners for a group from a file. Members can also be imported from an
  external data source.

You can specify schema attributes to be used for export/import, along with a user-friendly name for
each attribute.

- The import function reads the objects’ information from an external file or data source and
  searches for matching objects in the directory based on field mapping (where a column name in the
  file or data source is mapped to any of the attributes specified here).  
  Objects having the same values for the mapped fields are added to the membership or additional
  ownership of the target group.
- The export function reads the membership/additional ownership of the group and exports the values
  of the specified attributes for members/additional owners to an external file.

The schema attributes you specify are displayed with their user-friendly names on the following
wizards in the portal:

| Wizard Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Import Members           | This wizard is used to import members to a group using a file or an external data source. Users can launch it from the Members page on the Create Group wizard and from the Members tab in group properties. |
| Export Members           | This wizard is used to export the members of a group to an external file. Users can launch it from the Members tab in group properties.                                                                      |
| Import Additional Owners | This wizard is used to import additional owners to a group using an external file. Users can launch it from the Owners page on the Create Group wizard and from the Owner tab in group properties.           |
| Export Additional Owners | This wizard is used to export the additional owners of a group to an external file. Users can launch it from the Owner tab in group properties.                                                              |

attributes for a wizard.

# Specify Attributes for the Object Card

In the portal, the names of directory objects are displayed as links. When a user hovers the mouse
over this link, a card is displayed, showcasing information about the object. For a user object, for
example, the card displays the name, email address and phone number. It is as:

![usercard](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/usercard.webp)

For each object type, you can specify a different set of attributes to display on this card. For a
group, the card is as:

# Customize Properties Pages

Directory Manager enables you to customize the property pages displayed in the portal for these
directory objects:

- User
- Group (static group)
- Smart Group
- Parent Dynasty
- Middle Dynasty
- Leaf Dynasty
- Mailbox
- Contact
- Computer (Only available for adding to group memberships in the portal. Its properties are
  read-only.)

NOTE: A Microsoft Entra ID identity store does not support the _computer_ and _contact_ object
types.

In the Directory Manager portal, the properties page of an object has multiple tabs, where each tab
groups similar attributes. These tabs are referred to as categories.

You can customize the following:

**For a tab:**

- Add a new tab (category) to an object’s properties page
- Update the details for a tab
- Remove a tab from an object’s properties page

**For a field on a tab:**

- Add a field to a tab
- Update the details for a field
- Rearrange the fields on a tab
- Remove a field from a tab

What do you want to do?

- Add a Tab (Category)
- Update Tab Details
- Remove a Tab
- Add a Field to a Tab
- Update a Field
- Rearrange the Fields on a Tab
- Remove a Field from a Tab

## Add a Tab (Category)

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane; the **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** list, select a directory object to add a tab to its properties
   page.  
   The **Name** list displays the tabs (categories) currently available on the object’s properties
   page.
6. Click **Add**. The **Add Design Category** pane is displayed.
7. Enter a name for the tab in the **Name** box. The tab will be displayed on the object’s
   properties page with this name.
8. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The tab would be visible to
   users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. The tab would not be
   visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their direct
   reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

   - Select _Never_ to hide the tab from all users.
   - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the tab visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
     manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
     members or a user. For example:

     - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, the tab would
       be visible to group owners for their respective groups in the portal.
     - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Account_ tab in user properties, the tab would
       be visible to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.

   - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list,
     the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
     to make the tab visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
     users, such as the user’s manager. For example, if the _Self_ role is selected for the
     _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

     - A user can view the General tab on his or her properties page. He or she cannot view this
       tab on the properties page of another user.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot see it for another user.
     - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
     - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot view it for
       other users.

9. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles with
   a priority value higher than it can add and update the values of fields on this tab. If group
   owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot update the fields on the tab for
   their respective groups/direct reports. See [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

   - Select _Never_ to make the tab and its fields read-only for all users.
   - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case of a
     user or contact) to specify or modify the value of the fields on the tab. It would be
     read-only for other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if
     _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Email_ tab in group properties, it means that:

     - Only group owners can specify or modify the values of fields on this tab for their
       respective groups in the portal.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
     - Group members cannot specify or update field values.
     - A role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
       update field values.

   - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
     option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list.  
     Select _Self_ to enable the respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the
     fields on the tab. The tab would be read-only for the user’s manager and other users. For
     example, if _Self_ is selected for the _General_ tab in user properties, it means that:

     - Only the user can add and update the values of fields on the General tab of his or her
       properties page.
     - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update field values.
     - The user’s manager cannot specify or update field values.
     - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
       update field values.

5. On the **Properties** page, select a directory object in the **Select Directory Object** list.
6. In the **Name** list, click **Remove** for a tab to remove it.
7. Click **Save**.

## Add a Field to a Tab

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane.
5. On the **Properties** page, select a directory object in the **Select Directory Object** list.
6. In the **Name** list, click **Edit** for the tab you want to add a field to.
7. On the **Edit Design Category** pane, click **Add Field**; the **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select a schema attribute to link to this field.  
   Updating the field in the portal is akin to updating the value of this attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** box, enter a display name for the field. This name is the field’s label
   on the tab.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select the display type to use for rendering this field
    on the tab.  
    The list contains basic display types and custom display types defined on the **Custom Display
    Types** page. See the [Display Type Categories](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/configuration/display-types.md) topic.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The tab would be visible to
    users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It would not be
    visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their direct
    reports) if they fall under a lower priority role. See [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a user or contact). It would be hidden from other users, such as group
      members or a user. For example:

      - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in
        group properties, the field would be visible to group owners for their respective groups
        in the portal.
      - If _Manager and Owner_ is selected for the _Manager_ field on the _Organization_ tab in
        user properties, the field would be visible to managers for their direct reports in the
        portal.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list,
      the _Self_ option is also available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_
      to make the field visible to the respective user or mailbox. It would be hidden from other
      users, such as the user’s manager. For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on
      the _Phone/Notes_ tab in user properties, it means that:

      - A user can view the field on his or her properties page only. He or she cannot see this
        field on the properties page of another user.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot view it for another user.
      - User managers cannot view it for their direct reports.
      - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot view it for
        other users.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of this field. If group
    owners/user managers fall in a lower priority role, they cannot able to update the value of the
    field for their respective groups/direct reports. See [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to make this field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a user or contact) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for
      other users, such as group members or the respective user. For example, if _Manager and Owner_
      is selected for the _Expiration Date_ field on the _General_ tab in group properties, it means
      that:

      - Only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their groups in the
        portal.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
      - Group members cannot specify or update the field value.
      - A role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
        update the field value.

    - If you have selected ‘User’ or ‘Mailbox’ in the **Select Directory Object** list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to enable the
      respective user or mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. The field would be
      read-only for other users, such as the user’s manager or a role with a higher priority value.
      For example, if _Self_ is selected for the _Notes_ field on the _Phone / Notes_ tab in user
      properties, it means that:

      - Only the respective user can add and update the value of this field on the _Phone / Notes_
        tab in his or her properties page.
      - A role with a higher priority value cannot specify or update the field value.
      - The user’s manager cannot specify or update the field value.
      - A role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot specify or
        update the field values.

13. Click **Advanced Options** to display additional fields.
14. As mentioned for visibility level and access level, the field is visible and editable for
    members of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than it.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
15. In the **Tooltip Text** box, enter the text to display when a user hovers the mouse over the
    field.
16. In the **Max Length** box, enter a number that represents the maximum number of characters that
    users can enter as value for this field.  
    Entering _0_ indicates that users can enter an unlimited number of characters as value.
17. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types (User, Contact, and/or Group)
    that can be searched on the portal’s _Find_ dialog box, to set as value for the field.  
    The following display types support the **Find** dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, Directory Manager identifies that the value for the
    field has to be searched and selected using the _Find_ dialog box. The **Search Object Types**
    area is displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select
    _Group_, only groups can be searched and selected as value for the field.  
    You can launch the _Find_ dialog box from multiple portal pages to search for objects to
    designate as owners, managers, additional owners, members, and more. While specifying the
    searchable object type(s), you must be aware of the kind of value the field requires.

18. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to provide a value for the
    field.
19. Select the **Is Read Only** check box to make the field read-only.
20. Select the **Filter Bad Words** check box to ensure that users do not enter any bad word in this
    field.  
    A value entered for the field is checked against the words listed on the **Bad Words List**
    page. Matched values cannot be saved. See the [Manage the Bad Words List](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/configuration/portal-customization.md) topic.
21. The **Image Attribute** list is available when ‘DN’ is selected as the display type. This list
    supports ‘thumbnailPhoto’ as its value.

    - Select the ‘thumbnailPhoto’ attribute in the **Image Attribute** drop-down list when you want
      to auto upload an image for the field. Let’s assume you apply this setting for the Primary
      Manager field in group properties. In the portal, the primary manager's image will be
      displayed alongside his or her name on the group properties page.  
      Note that for the image to display, the ‘thumbnailPhoto’ attribute must have a value stored;
      in case of no value, an image placeholder is displayed.
    - If you do not want to auto upload an image for the field, clear the value in the **Image
      Attribute** box.

22. Click **OK**.  
    The field is displayed in the **Fields** area on the **Edit Design Category** pane. You can
    rearrange the fields, update field details, and even remove a field from the tab.
23. Click **OK**.
24. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.

# Specify Attributes for Organizational Hierarchy

Using the portal, you can view the organizational hierarchy for a user in the organization. This
hierarchy is displayed in graphical form, creating a kind of an organogram. It presents a 360° view
of the organization with the specified user as the focal point.

By default, the organizational hierarchy chart displays four attributes of a user: _title_, _display
name_, _email_, and _picture_. You can replace an attribute with another one but you cannot add or
remove attributes. Hence the attribute count remains ‘four’.

What do you want to do?

# Manage Property Validation Attributes

In Directory Manager, property validation applies to:

- Users
- Groups

### Profile Validation for Users

Profile validation is designed to ensure the accuracy of users’ information in the directory. It
applies to users who are members of the group specified for profile validation in an identity store.
These users must verify and update their directory profile information at a set frequency using the
portal.

While validating his or her profile, a user can:

- Update his or her directory profile information
- Change his or her primary manager
- Transfer his or her direct reports to another manager
- Terminate his or her direct reports

You can specify the schema attributes (fields) for user profile validation. These attributes
(fields) are displayed on the **Validate Profile Properties** window of the portal, where users can
validate and update the values for these attributes.

NOTE: A few fields for profile validation are specified in the default portal template. You can add
more fields, edit the existing fields, or remove them. However, the **My Direct Reports** field can
neither be edited nor removed.

### Property Validation for Groups

The Directory Manager administrator can enforce group owners to review and validate the attributes
and membership of an expiring group before renewing it. See the
[Enable Group Attestation](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/services/overview.md#enable-group-attestation)
topic.

While attesting a group in the portal, the owner can:

- Update a few attributes, such as the group’s display name, expiration policy, security type, etc.
- Verify the group’s membership and inactivate undesired members. Inactive members are removed from
  group membership instantly or after x number of days, depending on the configurations made by the
  administrator.

Group attestation applies to expiring groups with an expiry policy other than ‘never expire’.

You can specify the schema attributes (fields) for group attestation. These attributes (fields) are
displayed on the **Attest & Renew Group** wizard in the portal, where group owners can validate and
update the values for these attributes.

NOTE: A few fields for group attestation are specified in the default portal template. You can add
more fields, edit the existing fields, or remove them. However, the _Members_ grid can neither be
edited nor removed.

# Specify Smart Group Query Attributes

For an identity store, you can choose whether all or specific schema attributes should be available
on the following pages in the portal:

- The Query Designer, where you can specify queries for Smart Groups and Dynasties for membership
  update. The Query Designer can be launched from:

  - The Create Object wizard for Smart Groups and Dynasties
  - The properties page for Smart Groups and Dynasties
  - When you upgrade a static group to a Smart Group or Dynasty

  The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab
  of the Query Designer for building Smart Group/Dynasty queries.

  ![filter_criteria_tab](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/filter_criteria_tab.webp)

- The Sub-Manager Query Designer for a Recursive Managerial Dynasty, where you can specify a query
  for sub-manager selection.

  ![submanagerquery](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/submanagerquery.webp)

- The **Add Attributes** dialog box for Dynasties. The schema attributes you specify would be
  available in the _Group Items By_ field, which is used to divide the query results into groups.
  Directory Manager creates a new child group for each unique value of the attribute that users
  select in the _Group Items By_ field.

  ![addattributes](/img/product_docs/accessanalyzer/admin/datacollector/addattributes.webp)

- The Query Designer for importing members to a group using an external data source. The specified
  schema attributes would be available on the Filter Criteria tab of the Query Designer for building
  membership import queries.  
  You can launch this Query Designer using the **Import** button on the **Members** tab in group
  properties (for static groups, Smart Groups and Dynasties).  
  ![importmembers](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/importmembers.webp)
- The Query Designer for query-based search, where users can define a query to search the
  directory.  
  The schema attributes you specify would be available to portal users on the Filter Criteria tab of
  the Query Designer for building search queries.  
  Users can launch the Query Designer for searches from the portal’s Advanced Search page.

You can also specify the following for an attribute:

- The operator(s) that can be applied to the attribute on the Query Designer dialog boxes. For
  example, if you allow the ‘Contains’ and ‘Equals’ operators for the ‘cn’ attribute, then only
  these operators will be displayed when users select the ‘cn’ attribute on any of the Query
  Designers.
- The display type to use for specifying the value of the attribute. For example, it can be a simple
  text box, a drop-down list, or a button that launches the Find dialog box for searching and
  selecting an object.
- The maximum number of characters that users can enter as value for an attribute.

## Allow All Schema Attributes

# The ‘Send on Behalf’ and ‘Send As’ Permissions

Using the portal, a user can delegate the _Send on Behalf_ and _Send As_ permissions to other
objects.

### The Send on Behalf Permission

The _Send on Behalf_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 allows a user to send an email
as another user, while showing the recipient that it was sent from a user on behalf of another user.

For example, when User A grants Send on Behalf permissions to User B, then User B can send email on
behalf of User A. User B will be able to choose User A’s email address in the ‘From’ field when
composing a message in Outlook. Message recipients will see both User A’s address and User B’s
address, as the ‘From’ address will read as:

_From: Mailbox `<User B's address>` on behalf of Mailbox `<User A's address>`._

### The Send As Permission

The _Send As_ permission in Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 enables a user to send a message as
another user. For example, when User A grants _Send As_ permissions to User B, User B will be able
to choose User A’s email address in the ‘From’ field when composing a message in Outlook. This
message, while sent by User B, will appear as sent by User A.

### Prerequisites for the Send As and Send on Behalf Permissions

In the following content, a ‘target object’ refers to the object that can add other objects to its
Send As and Send on Behalf lists using the portal.

- The target object can be a mailbox or a mail-enabled group.
- Microsoft Exchange or Office 365 must be configured as the messaging provider for the identity
  store.
- An SMTP server must be configured for the identity store.
- The user logged in the portal must have the “Manage any Profile” permission for its respective
  role in the identity store.
- The XAdPermissionExtendedRights attribute should be available for Send As and the publicDelegates
  attribute should be available for Send on Behalf.
- The ExchangeTrustedsubsystem object should have modify permissions on the target objects in Active
  Directory for the Send As permission to be set using the portal. For more information, see
  [Access denied when you try to give user "send-as" or "receive as" permission for a Distribution Group in Exchange Server](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/access-denied-when-you-try-to-give-user-send-as-or-receive-as-permission-for-a-distribution-group-in-exchange-server-505822f4-8dca-7b97-d378-c8416553f6d2).

What do you want to do?

- Set up the Send As Feature
- Set up the Send on Behalf Feature

## Set up the Send As Feature

You can provide the Send As setting on any tab of an object’s properties page in the portal. This
would enable the object to delegate the Send As permission to users.

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** drop-down list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the
   Send As setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the object’s
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send As** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _XAdPermissionExtendedRights_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** box, provide a label for the field, such as ‘Send As Permissions’. The
   Send As field will be displayed with this name in the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select ‘DNs’.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send As field would be
    visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It would
    not even be visible to group owners (for their respective groups) and user managers (for their
    direct reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See
    [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send As field,
    i.e., add and remove objects in the Send As list. If group owners/user managers fall in a lower
    priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their respective
    groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the value;
      group members cannot change the value; and even a role with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission
      in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value cannot change the
      value; and even a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot
      change the value.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailbox’s manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portal’s Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send As_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, Directory Manager identifies that the value for the
    _Send As_ field has to be searched using the Find dialog box. The **Search Object Types** area
    is displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select User,
    only user objects can be searched and selected as value for the field.

15. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to add at least one object
    to the _Send As_ list.
16. Select the **Is Read Only** check box to make the _Send As_ field read-only.
17. Click **OK** on the **Add Field** pane and the **Edit Design Category** pane.
18. Click **Save** on the **Properties** page.

#### The Send As Field in the Portal

Launch the portal and go to the properties of the target object (group or mailbox) you defined the
Send As field for, then click the respective tab. The Send As field is displayed as follows:

![sendas](/img/product_docs/directorymanager/directorymanager/admincenter/portal/design/sendas.webp)

Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to add and remove objects in the Send As list. The added
objects can send email for the target object in accordance with the Send As functionality.

## Set up the Send on Behalf Feature

You can provide the Send on Behalf setting on any tab of an object’s properties page in the portal.
This would enable the object to delegate the Send on Behalf permission to users.

1. In Admin Center, select **Applications** in the left pane.  
   On the **GroupID Portal** tab, a portal's card displays its info.
2. Click the ellipsis button for a portal and select **Settings**.
3. Select an identity store under **Design Settings** to customize the portal for it.  
   All identity stores linked with the portal are listed under **Design Settings**. You can design a
   different portal for each of these.
4. Click **Properties** in the left pane. The **Properties** page is displayed.
5. In the **Select Directory Object** list, select a Mailbox or Group object to add the Send on
   Behalf setting to its properties page. The **Name** list displays the tabs on the object’s
   properties page.
6. Click **Edit** for a tab (for example, the **Email** tab).  
   The **Edit Design Category** pane is displayed, with the **Fields** area displaying the fields on
   the tab.
7. Click **Add Field** to add the **Send on Behalf** field. The **Add Field** pane is displayed.
8. In the **Field** drop-down list, select the _publicDelegates_ attribute.
9. In the **Display Name** provide a label for the field, such as ‘Send on Behalf Permissions’. The
   Send on Behalf field will be displayed with this name on the portal.
10. In the **Display Type** drop-down list, select ‘DNs’.
11. In the **Visibility Level** drop-down list, select a security role. The Send on Behalf field
    would be visible to users of this role and roles with a priority value higher than this role. It
    would not be visible to group owners (for their groups) and user managers (for their direct
    reports) if they fall in a lower priority role. See [Priority](/docs/directorymanager/11.1/administration/security-roles.md).

    - Select _Never_ to hide the field from all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to make the field visible only to the owner (in case of a group) or
      manager (in case of a mailbox). It would be hidden from other users, such as group members or
      the mailbox itself. In other words, the field would be visible to group owners for their
      respective groups and to managers for their respective direct reports in the portal.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the Select Directory Object list, the _Self_ option is also
      available in the **Visibility Level** drop-down list. Select _Self_ to make the field visible
      only to the mailbox on his or her properties page. It would not be visible to any other user,
      such as a role with a higher priority value or a role with the ‘Manage any profile’ permission
      in the identity store.

12. In the **Access Level** drop-down list, select a security role. Users of this role and roles
    with a priority value higher than this role can add and update the value of the Send on Behalf
    field, i.e., add and remove objects in the Send on Behalf list. If group owners/user managers
    fall in a lower priority role, they would not be able to update the value of the field for their
    respective groups/direct reports.

    - Select _Never_ to make the field read-only for all users.
    - Select _Manager and Owner_ to enable only the owner (in case of a group) or manager (in case
      of a mailbox) to specify or modify the value of this field. It would be read-only for other
      users, such as group members or the mailbox itself.  
      In other words, only group owners can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective groups in the portal. A role with a higher priority value, group members, or a role
      with the ‘Manage any Group’ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.  
      Similarly, only mailbox managers can specify or modify the value of this field for their
      respective direct reports in the portal. A role with a higher priority value or a role with
      the ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store cannot change the value.
    - If you have selected ‘Mailbox’ in the _Select Directory Object_ drop-down list, the _Self_
      option is available in the **Access Level** drop-down list. Select **Self** to enable the
      mailbox to specify or modify the value of the field. It would be read-only for other users,
      such as the mailbox’s manager or a role with a higher priority value or even a role with the
      ‘Manage any profile’ permission in the identity store.

13. As mentioned for access level and visibility level, the field is editable and visible to members
    of the selected role and roles with a priority value higher than the selected role.  
    In the **Exclude Roles** area, select the check boxes for the higher priority role(s) to deny
    them access and visibility on the field.
14. Use the **Search Object Types** area to specify the object types that can be searched on the
    portal’s Find dialog box, to set as value for the _Send on Behalf_ field.  
    The following display types support the Find dialog box:

    - DN
    - DNs
    - Custom display types created with the Grid type

    When you select any of these display types, Directory Manager identifies that the value for the
    _Send on Behalf_ field has to be searched using the Find dialog box. The **Search Object Types**
    area is displayed, where you can select the required object type(s). For example, if you select
    _User_, only user objects can be searched and selected as value for the field.

15. Select the **Is Required** check box to make it mandatory for users to add at least one object
    to the _Send on Behalf_ list.
