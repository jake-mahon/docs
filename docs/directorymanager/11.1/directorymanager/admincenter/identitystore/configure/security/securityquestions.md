# Manage the Local Question Pool

When you create a new identity store, four questions from the global question pool are added to the
identity store’s local pool by default. A local pool is maintained individually by each identity
store. You can modify a local pool by (a) adding questions from the global question pool, (b) adding
questions of your choice (questions that are not in the global pool), and (c) by removing questions
from it.

To enroll using security questions, identity store users must select a certain number of questions
from the local pool and provide answers.
