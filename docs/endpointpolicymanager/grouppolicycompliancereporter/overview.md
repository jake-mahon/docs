# Group Policy Compliance Reporter

Thank you for trying or purchasing Netwrix Endpoint Policy Manager (formerly PolicyPak) Group Policy
Compliance Reporter (GPCR). Endpoint Policy Manager GPCR reports whether something you wanted
delivered by Group Policy actually was delivered by the Group Policy engine. Endpoint Policy Manager
GPCR is made up of the following components:

- GPCR client (also known as the admin console): This is the main interface for Endpoint Policy
  Manager GPCR.
- GPCR endpoints: These are the machines you wish to get Group Policy data from.
- GPCR server (optional): This enables endpoints to push data to a common collection point and
  enables multiple administrators to share results and reuse each other's completed work.
