# Version Numbers

Because PolicyPak Application Settings Manager is updated regularly, it's possible you're not using the latest version. The most important things you can do before working with tech support would be to take the following steps:

__Step 1 窶点_ Download the latest version of the PolicyPak Application Settings Manager ISO from the Customer Portal. (The Customer Portal always has the latest version of PolicyPak Application Settings Manager.)

__Step 2 窶点_ Install the latest Endpoint Policy Manager DesignStudio tools on your Endpoint Policy Manager Creation Station.

__Step 3 窶点_ Recompile your pXML into a Endpoint Policy Manager DLL file.

__Step 4 窶点_ Ensure that you are running the latest version of the Endpoint Policy Manager CSE on every system (or at least a test system where you want to perform troubleshooting).

If those steps fail, and your problem reoccurs, please be prepared with the version information from the following areas, shown in Figure 98, Figure 99, and Figure 100.
