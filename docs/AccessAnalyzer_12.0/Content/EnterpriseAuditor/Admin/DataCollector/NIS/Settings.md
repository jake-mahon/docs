# NIS: NIS Settings

The NIS Settings page is where the NIS domain and a NIS server are configured for testing. It is a wizard page for both categories.

Configure the NIS domain and sample NIS server:

* NIS Domain Name – Enter the case-sensitive name of the NIS domain to scan. This is the value returned by `/bin/domainname` on UNIX systems.
* (Optional) Sample NIS Server – Enter the host name or IP address of a NIS server for the above domain to use for testing. This system should be running the `ypserv` process and be accessible from the Access Analyzer Console. Then, click **Test**.
* Test – The data collector attempts to connect to the specified server and access information from the specified domain. It returns a message indicating success or failure.
