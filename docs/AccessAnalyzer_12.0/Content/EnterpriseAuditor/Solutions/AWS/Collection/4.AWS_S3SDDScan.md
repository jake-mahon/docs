# 4.AWS\_S3SDDScan Job

The 4.AWS\_S3SDDScan job collects details about S3 objects containing sensitive data.

## Queries for the 4.AWS\_S3SDDScan Job

The AWS S3 Sensitive Data Scan query uses the AWS Data Collector to target all AWS instances and has been preconfigured to use the Collect SDD Data category.

**Step 4 –** On the Filter S3 Objects page, scope the scan to target specific S3 objects:

* Click **Add** to select from AWS Buckets in the target environment

**Step 5 –** On the Sensitive Data Settings page, configure the following options:

* Modify maximum file size to be scanned
* Add scanning offline files
* Modify file types to be scanned
* Enable differential scanning
* Modify the number of SDD scan processes

  ***RECOMMENDED:*** For optimal performance, the total number of scan processes on a scan host should be 1 to 2 times the number of CPU threads available.
* Enable Optical Character Recognition (OCR) scans

  **NOTE:** The OCR option is intended to work for clear scanned physical documents or documents directly converted to images, with standard fonts. It will not work for scanning photos of documents and may not be able to recognize text on images of credit cards, driver's licenses, or other identity cards.

* (Optional) Create custom criteria on the global **Settings** > **Sensitive Data** Node
* See the[Sensitive Data Criteria Editor](../../../SensitiveDataDiscovery/CriteriaEditor/Overview "Sensitive Data Criteria Editor") topic for additional information and instructions
