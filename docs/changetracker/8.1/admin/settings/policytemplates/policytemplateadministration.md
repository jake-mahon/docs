# Policy Template Administration

Edit and upload/download configuration policy templates – the default templates provided with
Netwrix Change Tracker are already aligned to default Device Groups, but this association can be
changed together with the make-up of the Configuration Monitoring policy

**NOTE:** Always click the **Save Changes** button after any edit.

To configure additional File/Folder/Registry Match Pattern definitions, click on the **Show Advanced
Options** button.
