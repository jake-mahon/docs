# Platforms Page

The Platforms page is accessible from the Navigation pane under Policies. The menu on the left
displays all the supported platform types and previously configured platforms. This allows
administrators to apply default configurations across all resources defined by that platform type.

The pane on the left side of the page displays a list of the configured platforms. The pane has the
following features:

- Search — Searches the table or list for matches to the search string. When matches are found, the
  table or list is filtered to the matching results.
- Copy icon — Create a new platform based on the current selection. Icon appears when platform is
  hovered over. This is intended to cover use cases where the built-in account differs from the
  norm.
- Trashcan icon — Deletes the platform. Icon appears when policy is hovered over and is only
  available for duplicated platforms. A confirmation window will display.
